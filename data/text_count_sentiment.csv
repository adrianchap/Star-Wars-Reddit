This more than anything, for me, shits on star wars. The rule of two was beautiful, it was complete, it worked and it ended the only way it possibly could - with an apprentice killing his master, without becoming the master, so that the line would be broken and the Sith would be ended - its single weakness. And in come these dumbass sequels with their ""force dyad"" BS where they literally shat over work done by FAR better writers. 

>Together Rey and Ben Solo would be the culmination of a prophesied Force dyad as well as the Rule of Two. Under the Rule of Two, the knowledge of the Sith passed from a Master to a more powerful apprentice, though its ultimate goal was to create a dyad between two Sith Lords. Darth Plagueis tried to create a dyad with his apprentice, Darth Sidious, who, in turn, tried to create one with Solo's grandfather, Anakin Skywalker. Despite years of searching, the Sith never found a way to form a dyad on their own. The Rule of Two was a pale imitation of the power that the Sith coveted. Sidious regarded it as an unworthy but necessary successor to the older, purer doctrine of the dyad that would be ultimately fulfilled by Solo and Rey

Wtf were they smoking when they came up with this asinine nonsense.

The rule of two was  explored in depth in the Darth Bane books - how and why Bane came up with it, Revan's thoughts about it, the flaws in the old methods of the Sith under the Dark Council. Bane started a series of events that would culminate with Palpatine dismantling the republic and organizing it into the Galactic Empire - The Sith had finally gotten their revenge.

15,Was Finn retconned into a janitor midday through TFA’s production because the writers didn’t want to deal with the baggage of writing a character that had done some genuine bad stuff in his past?,46,ja50d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ja50d8/was_finn_retconned_into_a_janitor_midday_through/,8,1602585731.0,"Some people myself included has pointed out that it is weird that Finn was on the same ship as Kylo was when they arrived at Crait when we are told later that it was his first event ever assignment as a Stormtrooper.

And then later we are told that he was actually a janitor on SKB.

Isn’t it kind of weird to go from a janitor to to then be assigned to such a priority mission like obtaining the map to Luke?

This got me thinking:

Is it possible that it was originally intended that Finn was actually suppose to be a experienced Stormtrooper that had actually gotten involved in several missions and been forced to kill innocent people but then the writers decided that they couldn’t deal with the baggage of writing a character that would have done some stuff like that so they retconned him to be a FO janitor and made it so that the mission on Jakku was his first ever assignment as a Stormtrooper even though it doesn’t make much sense?

Keep in mind that the Arndt has admitted that it was originally intended that Luke was suppose to be found midday through TFA and actually do stuff but then the writers feared he would overshadow the new characters so they reduced him to a cameo at end instead.

Given that the writers admitted that they didn’t have faith in their own ability to write intriguing original characters so they had to reduce Luke’s role it really doesn’t sound weird to me that writers would reduce Finn’s role as a Stormtrooper because they didn’t have much faith in their ability to write a protagonist that had done genuine bad stuff in his past.",saltierthancrait,was finn retconned into a janitor midday through tfa’s production because the writers didn’t want to deal with the baggage of writing a character that had done some genuine bad stuff in his past some people myself included has pointed out that it is weird that finn was on the same ship as kylo was when they arrived at crait when we are told later that it was his first event ever assignment as a stormtrooper then later we are told that he was actually a janitor on skb it kind of weird to go from a janitor to to then be assigned to such a priority mission like obtaining the map to luke got me thinking it possible that it was originally intended that finn was actually suppose to be a experienced stormtrooper that had actually gotten involved in several missions and been forced to kill innocent people but then the writers decided that they couldn’t deal with the baggage of writing a character that would have done some stuff like that so they retconned him to be a fo janitor and made it so that the mission on jakku was his first ever assignment as a stormtrooper even though it doesn’t make much sense in mind that the arndt has admitted that it was originally intended that luke was suppose to be found midday through tfa and actually do stuff but then the writers feared he would overshadow the new characters so they reduced him to a cameo at end instead that the writers admitted that they didn’t have faith in their own ability to write intriguing original characters so they had to reduce luke’s role it really doesn’t sound weird to me that writers would reduce finn’s role as a stormtrooper because they didn’t have much faith in their ability to write a protagonist that had done genuine bad stuff in his past,1,1772,322,1,0.062,0.856,0.082,0.7131

Han supposedly lived a life of dishonesty and selfishness, then turned his life around when he joined the rebellion. Solo kinda makes it look like he was always a good person, which makes his OT redemption arc less powerful. Personally I thought it was a fun movie if you took the lore inconsistencies with a grain of salt tho. Better than the sequels anyways...

Star Wars isn't just about Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. That story has already been told, and likely told the best anyone alive can write it, and reusing writing rarely ends well, and it wasn't even Disney's writing. It was the writing of the masterful creator of Star Wars and its founding ideas, and had more key ideas and guidelines for how Star Wars should be, most of which we don't know.

Disney didn't have the only mind that fully understood about Star Wars, only a few peoples' interpretations of it, and the fact that each fan has a unique perception of what Star Wars is and what makes it good is arguably the main reason why so many people hate the prequels: everyone had spent sixteen y ears building up more or less their own vision of Star Wars; what makes it good, what fits in the universe, where it would be good for it to go next, and more, and three movies could never completely fit any of those perceptions. The only way for everyone to like new Star Wars just as much as they loved what they first loved about Star Wars would be to make everyone their own movie, and even that wouldn't get close to fitting all their hopes.

You don't have to be George Lucas to make good content about a galaxy far, far, away: just look at Dave Filoni- but you need to have a sweeping view of your own and ideas that you can build on. For Kathleen Kennedy, Jar Jar Abrams, and Rian Johnson, this wasn't something to really think about. This was a four-year stint for some writers of bottom-shelf pop garbage. They weren't ready to face the fanbase, and Rian Johnson's ""YOur SnOke ThEOry SuCks"" photo was proof that he wasn't taking responsibility, he was just annoyed to be criticized at all, and that is NOT how you write Star Wars. Instead of keeping up with his endless self-worship and hating the fanbase for caring about the material, he just shrugged it off as being too lazy to make good on all-but historical movies.

Star Wars is a universe you have to think about and have a plan before going into. You can't just jump at what you think everyone likes and hate your own fandom for doing what a fandom is supposed to do. When Disney gave the deadlines for Star Wars, they should have refused the project, because these movies need respect and creativity.",saltierthancrait,hinging on ot nostalgia didnt work because thats not how star wars works making a trilogy about original  trilogy nostalgia was doomed to fail wars isnt just about luke skywalker and darth vader that story has already been told and likely told the best anyone alive can write it and reusing writing rarely ends well and it wasnt even disneys writing it was the writing of the masterful creator of star wars and its founding ideas and had more key ideas and guidelines for how star wars should be most of which we dont know didnt have the only mind that fully understood about star wars only a few peoples interpretations of it and the fact that each fan has a unique perception of what star wars is and what makes it good is arguably the main reason why so many people hate the prequels everyone had spent sixteen y ears building up more or less their own vision of star wars what makes it good what fits in the universe where it would be good for it to go next and more and three movies could never completely fit any of those perceptions the only way for everyone to like new star wars just as much as they loved what they first loved about star wars would be to make everyone their own movie and even that wouldnt get close to fitting all their hopes dont have to be george lucas to make good content about a galaxy far far away just look at dave filoni but you need to have a sweeping view of your own and ideas that you can build on for kathleen kennedy jar jar abrams and rian johnson this wasnt something to really think about this was a fouryear stint for some writers of bottomshelf pop garbage they werent ready to face the fanbase and rian johnsons your snoke theory sucks photo was proof that he wasnt taking responsibility he was just annoyed to be criticized at all and that is not how you write star wars instead of keeping up with his endless selfworship and hating the fanbase for caring about the material he just shrugged it off as being too lazy to make good on allbut historical movies wars is a universe you have to think about and have a plan before going into you cant just jump at what you think everyone likes and hate your own fandom for doing what a fandom is supposed to do when disney gave the deadlines for star wars they should have refused the project because these movies need respect and creativity,1,2420,441,1,0.081,0.772,0.148,0.9769

Poe clearly holds no respect in the Resistance for some reason in TLJ, so I don’t know what he’s gonna do, except go back to his racially stereotyped roots as a drug runner.

They clearly want nothing to do with Rose after TLJ.

But if they had put one iota of effort into developing Finns force sensitivity, they could have had him as a prominent figure in the Resistance (a real Big Shot) and go on missions to build up the New Republic while developing his force powers. But that just wouldn’t sell well in China.

I'll avoid the term ""Mary Sue"" here, because it can look sexist outside of the sequels criticism community.

**The Force Awakens**

1. Flying the Millennium Falcon without training. There are some shaky explanations for this out there, but I doubt there could be an intact, usable flight simulator on a 30+-year-old battleground on a corrosive, desert planet with a lot of scavenging going on. Does it even make much sense that professional warships would carry flight simulators? I'd appreciate some background from other content on this.
2. Using a Jedi mind-trick on a stormtrooper. Not only was this a blatant enough callback to *A New Hope*, she has literally no training at this point. She only learned that the Jedi had existed a few hours ago, and this was a pretty complex mindtrick.
3. ""I bypassed the compressor!"" Even if she had built her speeder herself, it would have been a big stretch to redo a system on a starship when she's never been on a starship before. Scavenging would teach her a few things about how ships should work, but not enough to do this!
4. Using a Force grab and defeating Kylo Ren, all *still* without training. Even with the little help from Finn and the blaster wound on Kylo's leg, realistically, the duel should have at least been very close, with Ren at a severe advantage. In Episode V, Luke trains with the former Jedi grandmaster for three days, and the best he can do is land one hit on Darth Vader. Rey has no Force training at all at this point and could have easily killed Kylo, who is basically at the level of a Sith Knight, if she wanted. But she doesn't, because plot reasons.

**The Last Jedi**

5. How Rey isn't caught by Luke coming back from the ~~Cave of Evil Clone~~ very original Dark Side-sensitive area. The rebellious-main-character-sneaks-around-and-is-embarrassingly-found-out-to-have-done-so trope sure is overused, but it's not nearly as tiresome as the other tropes other Disney princesses are put through, and felt like a necessary part of the story that was missing and could have been reflected better in the scene where Luke finds Rey sharing a vision with Kylo Ren. But maybe not. It would go against the diacritic between Luke and Rey, and this movie is blurred enough.

6. Rey and Kylo Ren being able to take down Snoke's guards was acceptable, but how hard they could pull on Luke's lightsaber was not. Not only is the tug-of-war-over-something-both-characters-want-until-it-breaks trope insufferably overused and lazy in the first place, even with the dyad, I doubt either of them could pull hard enough to cause heat seal of that strength. Not to mention that after she wakes up after the blast that probably should have killed them both, especially considering how much it must have drained them to pull on the lightsaber, Rey just picks up the pieces and walks away instead of killing Kylo in his unconsciousness and ending the war, because she's just so virtuous.

7. That all Rey's training at this point is hearing two vague paragraphs from Luke and she can Force lift fifty rocks. Size and weight don't matter in Force lifting, but I believe number of objects does.

**The Rise of Skywalker**

8. Rey one-shots rocket troopers with a blaster so outdated they wouldn't use it in Episode I.

9. Rey has no internal struggle in this movie. Her biggest fear is somehow turning to the Dark Side when she has absolutely no temptation to it at this point. In the Originals, George Lucas showed Luke's risk of turning to the Dark Side through his clothes. White when he was safest in ANH, tan when he was showed more power in TESB, and black in RoTJ, when he was almost a gray Jedi. I don't recommend them copying the originals this way, but the sequels had none of this tension. Not only does Rey go from slightly gray to pure white clothes, she is given multiple warnings of the Dark Side, like the ""dark Rey"" fight scene in which Rey is totally calm when an alternate her tries to lop her head off with a double lightsaber for two minutes, but panics when she shows slightly sharp teeth.

>!10. If her only fear was finding out who her parents were, Rey should have gone nuts when told she was a Palpatine.!<

>!11. Rey becomes immortal by crossing two lightsabers over her chest. Not normal lightsabers mind you, special Skywalker lightsabers, because that's all the Force is in the Disney Trilogy: it permeates stuff from the OT and makes it special somehow to accentuate the heaps of manufactured nostalgia these movies are meant to hinge on. Also, Palpatine is too easy. He is defeated for the fourth time because he can't wrap his head around the idea that when someone is deflecting your own Force lightning into your face and using it to kill you, then may-be YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP BLASTING AT IT YOURSLEF, AND OH, I DON'T KNOW, JUST FORCE-PUSH HER INTO THE PIT YOU USED TO NEARLY KILL KYLO 10 SECONDS AGO!! !<Sith hubris can't make you *that* dumb.

For almost 3 years now, together, we've dug deep in to the depths of the mines to find all the salt these hills have to offer. 

Over that time, we've slowly added, and adapted our rules to make this sub superiorly salty. 

Unfortunately, those rule changes started to bog down under their own weight, making it hard for us mods to moderate, and a bit tricky for some of you miners to follow those rules and report to us any thing that was a bit too... 

Flavourless? 

Unsavoury. 

So, with a little extra time on my hands, under the oversight of the rest of the Mod Team, I have made a few changes to our Official Rules.

The rules themselves haven't really changed too much this time, they're just been reworded and consolidated for clarity. Hopefully, this makes them more consistent, wherever you encounter them, easier to understand, and easier to follow. 

On top of that, we have added a reference to Reddit's new Content Policy, which we also hope to abide by (and in fact, has some very similar sentiments to our original rules). 

Some of you may have also noticed that a few weeks ago, the flair system was also overhauled so that posts can be more easily sorted and navigated by type (though I have done my best to maintain their salty flavour). I have written a guide to those new flairs, and stuck a concise key to them in the sidebar. Please try your best to use an appropriate flairs on your posts, so the sub is more user friendly for us all. 

If you've got any further suggestions for making our sub ever more salty, please let us know! 

Also, let us know if there's any kinks left to work out with any of this. We've tried our best to be through, but inevitably, things get missed.

Imagine if you will... The New Republic controls 60% of what the empire once controlled, the empire controls about 40%

The remnant has formed a new governmental system, its an empire in name only now.

She wants nothing to do with it, and the empire wants nothing to do with her. Until a group of Rogue troopers try to find her to restore the throne (Finns group)

92,The Resistance Members Act More Like Purgers Than Heroes,18,j7lxee,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j7lxee/the_resistance_members_act_more_like_purgers_than/,23,1602221337.0,"Star Wars heroes may have always seemed too kill-happy- Luke blows up a space station with over a million people on board- many of them stormtroopers in very similar situations as his was *hours* before, In Episode I, Padmé  ""discusses"" a trade deal with Nute Gunray at blasterpoint, and the Jedi ""victory"" of Episode II is rescuing a mere two Jedi and one senator at the cost of nearly 200 other Jedi.   
But they have almost always at least had understandable motives. The Death Star, for its crew of a million, had already wiped out a planet of multimillions, and was built, planned, and primed to do so again. Nute Gunray had invaded Naboo in the first place and tried to kill Padmé. Mace Windu, who led the Jedi assault on Geonosis, had tried to end it early on, and before one quick move, almost no Jedi died. He never could have expected it to get that destructive.

The sequels ""heroes"", however, take it one step further. Unlike the Rebellion before it, the Resistance doesn't fight the evil order to give the galaxy hope or freedom or to stand up against militarism. They do so because that's literally their entire goal: to destroy the First Order and kill everyone involved. They speak of hope for the galaxy, but see themselves as that only-all important hope, and in their view, they can do no wrong. In Episode VIII, Admiral Holdo gives a very subpar plan that got half the remaining Resistance killed and ""redeems herself"" by committing a war crime. Then, chronologically not two hours later, the Resistance tries to use a kamikaze speeder.

On Exegol in Episode IX, the Resistance throws off all regard of standards of honor and terms of surrender like never before. They swoop down on the Star Destroyers trapped in low orbit and mercilessly wreck every single one, purging every single living being inside to ash without a second thought. No one is allowed to surrender. No one is allowed to retreat. 

Not to mention that flying between the Star Destroyers, thus forcing them to shoot each other probably violated some standards of war.

Meanwhile, Rey brings down a cathedral of 10,000 people for chanting in the same room as Palpatine (who, despite not actually having an empire at this point, is always referred to as ""The Emperor"", for Original Trilogy nostalgia).

The whole premise of the final battle feels fundamentally wrong. The Resistance is supposed to be a heroic group that fights uphill battles against evil, and it hypocritically crushes a new movement before they get a chance to start. A generation spends their lives building a massive army and ten thousand huge Star Destroyers, each impressively with a planet-killing cannon, all in secret and without good supply lines, and some kids with a few plot holes and an ape covered in camel hair on their side dash down and destroy every one of them and all their life's work in hours. They are supposed to be the hope for those fighting against bad odds, and they eradicate an order that has fought its way through bad odds for decades.

I might sound partial to the Final Order, and I am. The Resistance wiped out what could actually have been a big step forward for the galaxy. Let me explain.

The galaxy has been lawless for over three decades. The Empire was cruel, but we've seen what happened when it fell, thanks to content like *The Mandalorian*. Junk dealers, gangs, and hirers of bounty hunters control people's lives perhaps even more tightly than the Empire. The price of basic things skyrockets. The greedy, violent underworld becomes mainstream society. All organized government disappears. It's a barbarian age with better technology, and the New Republic proves unable to fix it.

The Final Order could have been the best shot at ending the age of crime and poverty and uniting the galaxy again, however violently. If it really could succeed to ship out through the galaxy and carry out its plan to take system after system, no surviving force would be able to stop it. The pirate gangs would become irrelevant under the power of the Sith Eternal, and their activity would soon be put under control. Laws would again be put in place. The dark age would be forced to an end, however harshly.

Now Anakin killing the Emperor was the moment he fulfilled the prophecy. Anakin was redeemed and his story was over. But they had to bring back the Emperor in Episode 9 and have Rey kill Palpatine. Now going by that movies logic the Emperor is still alive because apparently if Rey kills him he can possess her. But if she really killed him for good she has done more than the Chosen One. She actually killed him not that fake shit that Anakin did and if there is peace for like 40 years than Rey has officially done more than the Chosen One which is just baffling to me.

Suddenly you didn’t care about your main character anymore because, ‘Oh fuck, Luke Skywalker’s here. I want to see what he’s going to do.” 

-Michael Ardnt, writer of the first draft of TFA.

Because of this logic, Luke went from appearing halfway through the film to the very end (presumably resulting in SKB randomly taking his place). But this logic doesn’t make a lot of sense. Luke is a character that fans have adored for over 40 years, it’s entirely reasonable to believe he would steal the show. It was the same with the well regarded Alex Guinness playing alongside the relative unknown Mark Hamill in ANH. 

Does this get in the way of your new characters? Yes, but if you as a writer follow the hero’s journey, then the wise mentor slowly fades into the background as your new character comes into your own (like ANH).

This comment just feels like they didn’t want to put in the work. They went in wanting Uber-god Rey and everything else was second.

I first saw the original Star Wars at a theater in the summer of 1977 as a child.  It had already been out for a while and after hearing all my friends talk about it, I begged my Mom to go see it and she finally caved.  By the time we saw it, *everybody* wanted to go see it.  They oversold the showing and we had to stand the entire time.  It didn’t matter.  I was entranced, ferried away to some wonderful other galaxy filled with awesome creatures and swords made of light.  Obviously, I became a fan that day and have enjoyed Star Wars in its many forms since then: Movies, books, comic books, clothing, toys, video games, collectibles, and even the sheets on my bed.  I say all of this to try and drive home the point that I am a huge fan and that Star Wars obviously has meant a lot to me.

But I don’t think there’s any point in getting angry about it. Ostensibly Lucas Star Wars and Disney Star Wars are two separate entities, and they have been since the day Lucas sold it.  Lucas had every right to sell it, and Disney had every right to buy it and run it into the ground.  They paid for it, they can do whatever they want with it.  I understood that the day Lucas sold it.  And no matter what Disney or anyone else says, they ARE two separate things and will always be viewed that way by everyone other than those who have an ax to grind.

To be quite honest I feel many fans set themselves up for disappointment because their expectations were simply too high.  You can’t catch lightning in a bottle.  There will only ever be that single moment in time I first saw the original Star Wars.  It is impossible to replicate that moment.

I also look at it another way: They are two commercial entertainment products, one Lucas and one Disney.  I have enjoyed one of the products very much, and probably spent way too much money on it over the course of my life, but it brought me joy.  That money spent was an investment in my happiness and I do not regret it.  It still love it.

I did not enjoy the Disney product much at all.  Overall it was an uninspired and inferior, poorly written imitation of the original product.  I watched each of the films only once, with the exception of Solo, which I did not see in a theater.  I purchased copies of The Force Awakens and Rogue One only.  Other than that, I have spent no money on the Disney product simply because I have not enjoyed it.  In my view I gave them ample opportunities to satisfy me and they failed.  I even kept my expectations low, knowing it was Disney, and they *still* failed.

Think about all the times someone created something original and great, that everyone went crazy over.  It became so popular that the creator built a franchise around it, with many offerings.  It became part of our culture.  Fans gobbled it up, untold fortunes were made, and then that creator sold it to a large corporation for a large payday.  *What usually happens when that corporation gets a hold of it?*

&#x200B;

Star Wars is over. It ended they day Lucas sold it. It can never come back. We will never feel the same way we did as the first time we saw it.  I have let it go, if you pardon the pun.

I don’t *hate* Disney.  Disney doesn’t owe me anything.  And I don’t owe them anything, either.  Their only job was to produce a product that I might enjoy.  It is up to me whether I choose to spend money on that product.  It is their job to convince me.  They told me that their product met the Star Wars standard, but it did not, and so I did not return.

That’s it. Yes, I’m sad about it.  Yes, it’s a huge wasted opportunity now with Carrie gone.  Yes, there’s a hole in my heart.  But it doesn’t require me to get angry or yell at people or lose sleep over it.  And I'm not interested in watching a Disney ""We'll get it right this time!"" wild goose chase.  For all my love for Lucas Star Wars, for all its impact on the world, I still understand that it is a work of fiction and a product of entertainment.  I kept my expectations in check.  It would’ve been unreasonable for me to believe that Disney would’ve *ever* lived up to Lucas’ standards or vision.

117,What kind of Sith Lord do you prefer and want to see?,23,j6frxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j6frxf/what_kind_of_sith_lord_do_you_prefer_and_want_to/,40,1602054622.0,"Each of the sith lords in the list have defining characteristics. A lot of people might not agree with my assessments of each one of the votes, but please vote nonetheless. I would gladly expand the list, but it seems limited. Additionally I left out snoke because he was simply a shallow copy of the OT Palpatine (Not the PT palpatine who was a master manipulator) 

**Vader** \- The most well known, a man whose fall to the dark side is fueled by his intense desire to protect the ones he loves, the failure at being unable to do that, finally redeemed by protecting his son. A tragic figure whose downfall was that he loved too much to let go. He represents the willingness to let the galaxy burn to save the ones you love. And if you lose them, all that remains is raw hatred.

**Revan** \- A jedi who fought the mandalorians and was driven to the dark side by the cold harsh realities of war and what it takes to achieve victory. He fought first out of compassion to protect the outer rim from the mandalorians and ended up becoming more like them, eventually winning. A lot of Revan can also be seen in Anakin skywalker during the clone wars, but Anakin's final reason for falling is to protect the ones he loves, as opposed to Revan who simply understood that peacekeepers don't win wars.

**Kylo** \- An immature rage, strong nonetheless but fueled by conflict and confusion. Represents a man who has pledged himself to the dark side without fully understanding what it entails. Represents conflict, rush to judgment, quick to anger, the raw potential of a youth given too much power too quickly. Betrayal by a trusted father figure drives him embrace his dark side in a self fulfilling prophecy. 

**Sidious** \- The Dark side given form - a master of manipulation, politics and deception who understood that the true power of the dark side isn't lightsaber combat or force lightning but rather deception and manipulation. Power is absolute control. A master who manipulated the entire galaxy like a chess board. A dire warning to all about the effectiveness and perils of fear mongering, false flag operations and how they fuel the rise of dictatorships.

**Maul** \- Raw, unbridled rage given form in the perfect warrior. A lone assassin that does one thing and does it extremely well. Give him a target and it will die. If Dooku and Sidious hid a cold rage that they could control and use, Maul's rage is white hot and is expressed in combat. (I personally like to think Obi-Wan tapped into his anger in order to beat maul)

**Bane** \- A man who rebelled against the teachings of the dark council, obliterated it and reformed it into the rule of two. Without Bane, there would be no Sidious. A vote for Bane means that you'd like to see a sith lord who rebels against conventional power structures and destroys them to reform them in his own way. Bane's struggle is as much against the dark council as it is against the Jedi he hates. The man who recognized that the Dark council structure of the sith where each Lord was ""equal"" was just a perversion of the jedi order that must be destroyed if that Dark side was to win.

IMO, Rebels is the only part of Disney Star Wars that manages to truly live up to the standards of the George Lucas era (even including Rogue One and The Mandalorian). 

The protagonist, Ezra Bridget, is actually well thought out and his own person. He actually needs a lot of training and gradually improves before he can become a Jedi (something that people like JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson don’t seem to understand), which makes it so much more satisfying and engaging to follow his story. In season 1, he has trouble using even the most basic force powers: he can’t deflect orbs being thrown at him, and he has trouble using the force to influence the minds of tiny cats. Yet, by the end of the series, he dominates the mind of an AT-DP Walker with ease, making the pilot destroy his whole Stormtrooper squadron, then compelling him to commit suicide. Then, he takes on three Royal Guards, and manages to win. 

He has his own way of using the force; namely, to interact with animals. He doesn’t ONLY know generic stuff like moving boulders or doing mind tricks (He does that too, though) ; they give him his own, personal way of character growth. 

And the villains are absolutely top form. Palpatine is scarier than he’s ever been, and they even manage to bring back his kind and undeformed prequel trilogy body in hologram form to trick Ezra into abandoning his friend. However, when Ezra refuses, the hologram starts flickering between his kindly form and his evil, Sith form. It’s absolutely amazing and genuinely eerie imagery; seeing his false, kindly form constantly flickering into his true, evil form. And one of the later episodes has perhaps the most epic death scene in all of Star Wars; certainly pulverising all the weak and silly death scenes from the Sequels. 

Maul is great in this, too. You really get to see how the Sith have broken him, and at the end of his story, you finally get to see his true thoughts on everything that has happened. 

Ahsoka’s in it too, and she’s as cool as you’d expect (ie we see no scenes of her chugging green manatee milk straight from the teats).

121,I am extremely forgiving towards films and stories...which is why I was so shocked at just how much I hated the Sequels,56,j6bnq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j6bnq3/i_am_extremely_forgiving_towards_films_and/,3,1602041112.0,"There are many films/film series that others consider to be ""bad"" that I really enjoy. The best examples I can think of are: the Jurassic World films, the Prequel Trilogy and The Hobbit Trilogy. Many on the internet have criticised these flms, and I understand why. I agree that, in many instances, they did make errors in terms of execution. For example, there were some silly scenes in The Hobbit where Thorin balances on Smaug's nose and surfs down a river of gold, and the Prequels of course have the famous clunky dialogue.

However, I still love these films for one reason; the story, themes and characters are, when you get right down to it, very clever and well thought out. After seeing these films, I didn't really remember or think about specific scenes which they messed up; rather, I remembered the ""essence"" of these stories; the writing, character development and the themes. One of the themes of The Hobbit, for example, is not to let yourself get so devoured by greed that you forget your family, and one of the themes of the Prequels is how you shouldn't force people to pretend not to care about their loved ones. I can overlook a few lines about sand, or a few overblown action sequences, if these ideas are portrayed well.

After seeing The Force Awakens, I thought about it, and the more I thought about it, the less I liked it. I couldn't come up with any proper themes or ideas; it just seemed to be entirely populated by action sequences, with maybe one or two lines about ""oh you have to leave your parents behind"" to give the film the false appearence of being meaningful. It wasn't consistent; Finn doesn't want to kill, yet he suddenly loves blowing up troopers who are basically his brothers and sisters. Charcters like BB-8 just seemed to be added for merchandising : aside from act as a glorified USB holder, what does he actually do? And Rey didn't go under any development at all; she literally spent the entire story solving every goddamn problem with skills she pulls out of thin air, even though she didn't spend ANY of the story learning these skills (saying ""she learned these skills before the story"" doesn't work, because you could make that excuse for literally any fictional character in all of history). What is the message here supposed to be? That you can solve every problem you come across easily?

The original trilogy and the prequel trilogy did an excellent job of showing how fascism could rise to power with Palpatine manipulating various people to him using the fight with Mace Windu as a way of gaining more power and getting rid of freedom. In essence, the prequel trilogy was a rise to fascism and the sequels show how oppressive and authoritarian the regime was. Furthermore, when Anakin says, ""I have brought peace, justice, and security to my new empire"", it actually captures the fascist ideology quite perfectly from the side of the oppressor because anyone who has studied history will tell you that the evil dictators do not see themselves as being evil for the sake of being evil, they see themselves as being good and helping the country. 

With the Disney trilogy, this entire message and ideology was lost and the only thing that remained was the aesthetics of fascism but ideologically, it was devoid of any real meaning which is a shame since it could have had a real impact. The fact that in the rise of skywalker, Palpatine wanted to simply destroy planets is utterly absurd and it's no different from comic book villans who want to destroy just because they're evil.

124,Starship Fuel,21,j69lz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j69lz6/starship_fuel/,20,1602034849.0,"Okay, let's say that starships in GFFA are powered by fuel-burning engines instead of having some sort of... reactor core that can power them indefinitely. That's fine. The problem being:

1.	TLJ takes place directly after TFA. Last time we checked, the Resistance still had the New Republic's support. Yet in TLJ, over the course of, like, a day, the entire fleet is running out of gas. You'd think Leia would've kept a full tank. Is this just how quickly ships run out of fuel in Star Wars? Do Star Destroyers have to refuel every couple days or they'll stop dead? Is the Millennium Falcon more self-sufficient than your average capital ship?

2.	And this is all from moving at sublight speeds. You'd think going to hyperspace would be the big power drain or require some special fuel--no, it's just ordinary flying from Point A to Point B. Does that sound weird to anyone else? That you can make as many trips as you want from star to star, but traveling from Earth to the moon, that's a real hardship.

3.	Oh, and THERE'S NO FRICTION IN SPACE. What exactly are the Resistance ships burning fuel to do?

Namely, that Kylo was able to use the force to save someone he loved from death, something that Anakin tried and failed to do himself and thus this ties up the saga in a nice little bow. 

This notion to me is a fundamental misunderstanding of Anakin's character arc and the themes of the Saga as a whole. 

Anakin in the Prequels is terrified of the deaths of his loved ones, namely his mother and Padme. It is this fear of loss that drives him to the dark side and seek for a way to prevent people from dying. He believes if he just becomes more powerful, he can stop this from happening.

And this is where Palpatine comes in, by manipulating him with the story of his master being able to keep the ones he cared about from death. 

The Sith seek to control life and death, forever seeking immortality and not accepting the natural order of things. On the other hand the Jedi see death as a natural part of life, a path that all of them must take.

It's for this reason George was against the idea of Sith force ghosts. It's a poetic irony in that the Jedi can gain a form of spiritual immortality after death by accepting their death and role in the natural order, but the Sith who never accept this and seek to control it will never achieve this. This is also another reason why its a mistake for Palpatine to come back after death and be all powerful. 

As Obi-Wan says to Vader,""if you strike me down, I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine"". Obi-Wan isn't talking about power in the sense of strength or destructive capability. He's talking in the spiritual sense, and the ability to pass knowledge onto those who come after you. At the time Vader cannot conceive of power in this way, it's all about strength and control. 

And then we come to the climax of ROTJ where Luke pleads for his father to save him from Palpatine. And at this moment Anakin DOES FINALLY save someone he loves from death. But does he do so by trying to control life and death and perverting the natural order through the force? No, he does so through personal sacrifice out of love and through acceptance of his own death as a result. This is why he tells Luke that nothing can stop his death now, why he tells Luke ""You already have [saved me]"", and finally why he is able to come back as a force ghost. 

Kylo using the force to bring Rey back to life is not achieving what Vader started, he already achieved that at the end of his arc in ROTJ. It is a perversion of the natural order, something the Sith would seek to do, not the Jedi. 

In summary: Kylo's use of Force healing to raise Rey from the dead in TROS is antithetical to the meaning of Anakin's arc, the Star Wars Saga and the philosophy of George Lucas.",saltierthancrait,kylo finished what vader started  a counter argument after tros a sudden talking point arrived in defence of the use of force healing and the necessity of the st  that kylo was able to use the force to save someone he loved from death something that anakin tried and failed to do himself and thus this ties up the saga in a nice little bow  notion to me is a fundamental misunderstanding of anakins character arc and the themes of the saga as a whole  in the prequels is terrified of the deaths of his loved ones namely his mother and padme it is this fear of loss that drives him to the dark side and seek for a way to prevent people from dying he believes if he just becomes more powerful he can stop this from happening this is where palpatine comes in by manipulating him with the story of his master being able to keep the ones he cared about from death  sith seek to control life and death forever seeking immortality and not accepting the natural order of things on the other hand the jedi see death as a natural part of life a path that all of them must take for this reason george was against the idea of sith force ghosts its a poetic irony in that the jedi can gain a form of spiritual immortality after death by accepting their death and role in the natural order but the sith who never accept this and seek to control it will never achieve this this is also another reason why its a mistake for palpatine to come back after death and be all powerful  obiwan says to vaderif you strike me down i will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine obiwan isnt talking about power in the sense of strength or destructive capability hes talking in the spiritual sense and the ability to pass knowledge onto those who come after you at the time vader cannot conceive of power in this way its all about strength and control  then we come to the climax of rotj where luke pleads for his father to save him from palpatine and at this moment anakin does finally save someone he loves from death but does he do so by trying to control life and death and perverting the natural order through the force no he does so through personal sacrifice out of love and through acceptance of his own death as a result this is why he tells luke that nothing can stop his death now why he tells luke you already have saved me and finally why he is able to come back as a force ghost  using the force to bring rey back to life is not achieving what vader started he already achieved that at the end of his arc in rotj it is a perversion of the natural order something the sith would seek to do not the jedi  summary kylos use of force healing to raise rey from the dead in tros is antithetical to the meaning of anakins arc the star wars saga and the philosophy of george lucas,1,2891,541,1,0.171,0.731,0.098,-0.991

There’s a major difference. The PT used familiar elements to tell a new story, while the ST used those familiar elements to tell the same story but with different characters. 

Anakin blowing up the Trade Federation ship is an homage to Luke blowing up the Death Star, however the context is different, yeah they’re both evil space stations owned by the bad guys. In the OT the Death Star meant imminent destruction of the Rebellion, it was the direct threat. The Trade Federation ship was not a direct threat, the direct threats were the droids and Maul who were on Naboo. The Ship was just a control ship and blowing it up simply meant the deactivation of the droids. However the Gungans could have defeated the droids without its destruction. 

Now let’s compare SKB to the Death Star. Both are evil bad guy space stations/bases. Both have the power to destroy planets. However the thing that makes SKB different is that it can destroy entire systems instead of just one planet. Both serve the same role in the plot, as by the end of the film SKB is about to destroy the Resistance Base.

To name a few examples

* Hux is goaded into allowing a Starfighter into point blank range with one of their fleet’s more valuable assets, he doesn’t launch a fighter screen to keep that fighter at bay, and when a real danger is detected, still does nothing. Captain Canady is left to launch his own fighters from Fulminatrix, and gets no support from Hux or the rest of the First Order fleet. Hux doesn’t launch support fighters, direct their batteries to put up defensive fire covering the dreadnought, nothing, no he’s too busy massaging his bruised ego because some flyboy put him on tilt with what amounts to a practical joke, and an 8km long warship pays the price for Hux’s incompetence.
* The Resistance utilizes bombers that are vastly inferior to ones their predecessors have used in past films.
* Poe's single X-Wing is able to take out every single gun on a massive capital ship containing hundreds of enemy soldiers before any TIE Fighters are deployed.
* Leia orders The Resistance bombers to turn around when they are halfway to their target, even though they are so slow and vulnerable that at that point, they would easily be destroyed if they tried to abandon their mission.
* Even after destroying The Dreadnought, which saves The ENTIRE Resistance(as the Dreadnought would have been able to easily destroy The Resistance Fleet during the ensuing slow chase), Poe is reprimanded by Leia despite her terrible command decision, and the movie tries to portray her as being in the right.
* The First Order ships chase The Resistance at normal speed instead of simply having some jump ahead of The Resistance fleet to cut them off, which could have singlehandedly ended the movie at any time.
* And now onto the chase, or as I like to call it “the dumbest bit of military nonsense since the Emu war.” You have the First Order Fleet chasing the Resistance flotilla, supposedly the Resistance fleet is “faster” but they aren’t opening the gap between them and the First Order because… it would burn more fuel (because inertia isn’t a thing in Star Wars Space)? So they stay just at the extreme range of the First Order’s guns, and the Raddus has to be on the receiving end of a potshot every once in a while. Meanwhile said Resistance ships are flying in a straight line, direct away from the First Order fleet, so why not just set course past them and Hyperspace in front of them and catch them in the middle? Are interdictors at play here? Are they content to just think the fleet will run out of fuel and they can just catch them? It bothers me to understand that the heroes are only alive because of the gross incompetence of the First Order, because it doesn’t speak well to the capabilities of the heroes.
* The Resistance is shown to have hyperspace-capable ships on board their capital ship, but does not use them to go secure more fuel or make multiple trips to evacuate small groups of people at a time, instead using one for the Canto Bight sequence.
* Holdo didn’t just keep Poe in the dark, she kept the ENTIRE RESISTANCE in the dark.
* Holdo refuses to tell Poe, the second-highest-rankng Resistance official present, that she even has a plan, let alone details of it, even after he and many others rightfully express their concerns.
* Holdo still refuses to tell Poe her plan when he and many others mutiny, at which point she has every reason to believe that everyone on board that ship will die if Poe goes through with his own plan.
* Connix assisted in Poe’s mutiny and she is  the “ultimate authority” on carrying out a retreat. Why was she not told about the plan? Her position and placement on the bridge next to Holdo is pretty “need to know”.
* Holdo plans to have The Resistance flee to Crait in escape pods that are easily detectable and shot down, and then waits until many of them have been destroyed before resorting to the hyperspace jump maneuver.
* And, most egregiously of all, the hyperspace maneuver itself, whereby all of star wars combat is irrevocably altered by Johnson's inclusion of a devastatingly effective technique that has never been possible in the lore up until this point.
* So now the Resistance is stuck on Crait, the First Order knows they are there, we know implicitly that the First Order has more than one dreadnought in their fleet, we also know the Resistance is fresh out of bombers. Maybe instead of calling for a costly ground invasion just call in another dreadnought or unleash your Star Destroyers for an orbital bombardment of Crait and finish the job once and for all. This isn’t next level thinking, this isn’t superior tactics. This is using a rock to smash a bug levels of thinking. But they don’t, they land a ground invasion bigger than Hoth and bring a mini Death Star with them because they just had to have a copy of Empire didn’t they? Note again, that while Hoth was defended by more men with better equipment, Crait is defended by a quarter as many with rusting, dilapidated equipment… but it was enough to keep the Order stalled for Luke Skywalker to video-conference in.
* Failure to Blockade and Control the Theater of Operations. But more on the invasion, there is apparently no fleet around Crait, no blockade, no nothing, because the Millennium Falcon is allowed to enter the planet and escape completely unhindered and unchased by the First Order with the remaining resistance fighters aboard. Yeah, you read that right, the Resistance can now fit on the Falcon, but no, they didn’t lose, they live to fight another day, by the grace of the Order’s incompetence.",saltierthancrait,"the incompetence of the resistance and the first order in the last jedi both parties make baffling decisions that show neither knows how to conduct warfare in the established rules of the star wars universe to name a few examples hux is goaded into allowing a starfighter into point blank range with one of their fleet’s more valuable assets he doesn’t launch a fighter screen to keep that fighter at bay and when a real danger is detected still does nothing captain canady is left to launch his own fighters from fulminatrix and gets no support from hux or the rest of the first order fleet hux doesn’t launch support fighters direct their batteries to put up defensive fire covering the dreadnought nothing no he’s too busy massaging his bruised ego because some flyboy put him on tilt with what amounts to a practical joke and an 8km long warship pays the price for hux’s incompetence

FUNNNY!!! HAHA FUNNY GAG.

So why is this a microcosm of everything wrong with the sequel trilogy? In the original film C-3PO had a silver leg, when filming the oriignal A New Hope the leg on the c-3PO costume shattered and injured actor Anthony Daniels (see empire of dreams)

And they replaced the leg with that of the silver protocol droid costume... This created an iconic interesting visual for hte character of C-3PO, granted one that often went ounnoticed.

(but if you had been on the theme part ride you woulda seen it very clearly)

So this reveals a few things about the process of film making.

The people at lucasfilm who care about this property, they had zero power and authority on making the film. They were either incapable of speaking up or being ignored... that or they were to shy to say ""this gag doesn't work because Threepio always had a part that didnt match""

It reveals Disney just handed JJ the keys and didnt hold him to any standard.

but I think what is most damning of all is the simple reality of the situation... JJ abrams didnt care, he didnt care even a little bit, he couldnt be bothered to look at a fucking PICTURE of the cahracter before including them in the film.

To me, this along with the destruction of the hosnian system were when the franchise fully died for me.

(If you are going to destroy the capital of the republic, grow some balls and destroy coruscant, dont create decaf coruscant... Destroy a world we saw over the course of three movies, a movie oft-loved by the fans, the center of civilization in the galaxy that without would completely change the political landscape of the galaxy, the economics, and completely ruin the univers... and set the first order apart from the empire, by showing that they are more concerned with destruction and vengeance than control)

To break it down: the campaign centers around the New Republic trying to build and deploy a ""Starhawk,"" a ship never mentioned in any major piece of media except a TLJ novelization and the *Star Wars: Armada* tabletop game. It's a giant capital ship jury-rigged together out of Star Destroyer parts. It's superweapon is a giant... tractor beam. Yeah. Real exciting stuff.

Now, this isn't that bad on it's own, like hey, maybe they do something cool with this. Endgame spoiler alert: >!It gets heavily damaged by the player squadron on the Imperial side so they ram it into a destroyed moon in order to detonate it and destroy a bunch of Star Destroyers.  !<This part is actually funny because you start to realize this story has a lot more in common with an *Ace Combat* game than Star Wars. It's a big *whoosh* of missed potential, however. 

The Imperial side of the campaign is a lot more interesting - you get bits and pieces of internal politics about the remnants of the Empire, one squadmate argues to re-establish the Imperial Senate, there's a mission where you have to >!steal warheads from an Imperial storage facility!< under the cover of a Rebel assault, and there's one squadmate who's a sort of Darth Vader type being kept alive by cybernetics, but he has to keep the helmet on or he dies, and you get to see the cost of this war and how it's affected him. It actually feels somewhat believable and you're actually invested in seeing how this threads pay out, even if they never really do, since y'know... the Sequel Trilogy basically pissed all over the possibility of that happening. But you get the flavors of back stabbing, internal post-ROTJ Imperial politics, and somewhat compelling squadmates to fight alongside.  

The New Republic side of the campaign is just... god-awful. Like, an absolute nightmare of cringe, and by the end of it you just want to barf, you get like 2-3 friendship speeches and just the worst cliché after cliché... *""Vanguard Squad doesn't give in,""* the usual ""I was gonna go be a loner but now I wanna fly with my buddies in Vanguard,"" etc. and it all feels so unearned and painful to try and sit through. 

Battlefront 2 had a lot of this problem too, especially with Inferno Squad going turncoat. I'm just amazed at this point, the actual game itself is... *fine,* albeit limited and more arcade-y than I'd prefer, and no idea if they're going to add more ships like the B-Wing and the Lambda Shuttle. But the story, mainly the New Republic side, is painful in just how thoughtless and lazy it is, and it really makes you wonder how anyone is getting paid to write this slop anymore - they've clearly ran out of ideas a long, long time ago, and are scraping the bottom of the damn barrel for clichés.",saltierthancrait,sqsquadrons spoilers the star wars squadrons new republic campaign shows that nobody at disney or ea knows how what to do with the good guys after return of the jedi so i just finished star wars squadrons its all one campaign but you jump back and forth between two factions for like 68 hours or so and i figured youd appreciate snorting some salt about it it is like 3070 goodbad and the imperialtitan side of the campaign is way way more interesting and compelling or at the very least listenable than the completely cringeworthy new republicvanguard campaign  break it down the campaign centers around the new republic trying to build and deploy a starhawk a ship never mentioned in any major piece of media except a tlj novelization and the star wars armada tabletop game its a giant capital ship juryrigged together out of star destroyer parts its superweapon is a giant tractor beam yeah real exciting stuff this isnt that bad on its own like hey maybe they do something cool with this endgame spoiler alert it gets heavily damaged by the player squadron on the imperial side so they ram it into a destroyed moon in order to detonate it and destroy a bunch of star destroyers  this part is actually funny because you start to realize this story has a lot more in common with an ace combat game than star wars its a big whoosh of missed potential however  imperial side of the campaign is a lot more interesting  you get bits and pieces of internal politics about the remnants of the empire one squadmate argues to reestablish the imperial senate theres a mission where you have to steal warheads from an imperial storage facility under the cover of a rebel assault and theres one squadmate whos a sort of darth vader type being kept alive by cybernetics but he has to keep the helmet on or he dies and you get to see the cost of this war and how its affected him it actually feels somewhat believable and youre actually invested in seeing how this threads pay out even if they never really do since yknow the sequel trilogy basically pissed all over the possibility of that happening but you get the flavors of back stabbing internal postrotj imperial politics and somewhat compelling squadmates to fight alongside   new republic side of the campaign is just godawful like an absolute nightmare of cringe and by the end of it you just want to barf you get like 23 friendship speeches and just the worst cliché after cliché vanguard squad doesnt give in the usual i was gonna go be a loner but now i wanna fly with my buddies in vanguard etc and it all feels so unearned and painful to try and sit through  2 had a lot of this problem too especially with inferno squad going turncoat im just amazed at this point the actual game itself is fine albeit limited and more arcadey than id prefer and no idea if theyre going to add more ships like the bwing and the lambda shuttle but the story mainly the new republic side is painful in just how thoughtless and lazy it is and it really makes you wonder how anyone is getting paid to write this slop anymore  theyve clearly ran out of ideas a long long time ago and are scraping the bottom of the damn barrel for clichés,1,3341,585,1,0.157,0.734,0.108,-0.9905

&#x200B;

First there are the groups of people who claim to be progressive (little p not the party) .

However this movie is everything bout progressive. The black lead is the written out. The actor even said it . The female lead loses everything that made her , her and now only cares about saving Kylo. Speaking of which he knocked off a minority for both the co-lead and the lover spot.

People who like good movies. The plot of this movie falls apart when you take a deeper look into. People love to yell about subversion and going deeper. However if you really do that you can find so many holes in the movie.

Then there are people who love the ""darker sadder Luke"" then at the same time they wish Kylo could live happily ever after. How can you be okay with turning Luke into a Hobo just to cheer for that mass murderer.

People who like actions.  The action stuck in this movie. The Bombers were not logical at all. And in freaking space there was a slow speed chase. A horrible fight in a room where the bad guys literally matched the color of the wall.

And yet with all of this. People swear by it . I do not understand it at all. Like there are a ton of movies that other people like that I don't. However I still get it, like  Fast & Furious  movies. I can't stand them. But I know what people like about them. They have over the top action. Cute girls, hunky guys, and sports cars. But I just don't see the why people would like TLJ.  I know there is a joke about here that people say don't think consume. I understand that..but they just don't consume that defend.  I like Street Fighter the movie. And if someone told me Joey that is a bad movie, I would say yep. But it has Ken and Balrog in it. I would not act like it was good beyond that.

-Firing on the base first


This was one of the many major flaws TFO made. Instead of opening fire on the evacuation ships, which would most likely severely damage or destroy all of them and allow for the easy capturing of all members on board and securing the base, they fired on the base, needing to waste time charging the guns again. 


-Fleet formation


The resurgents where literately just there the entire time, not even covering or protecting the dreadnought, having the resurgent cover  and make a grid around the dreadnought would make it harder for fighters to attempt to fight.



-Not deploying TIEs.


The FO deployed their ties too late, only when Poe came. Even if there’s a small chance of an attack, even afew recon squads sent out to intercept any fighters sent by the resistance would work.


-Failing to destroy a single bomber



I don’t need to explain this one. 


-Dreadnought armament 


Ships that are made for orbital bombardment are not a bad idea. However the one the First Order made is just awful. Only armed with PD cannons and their man guns, these ships have little to no tactical advantage unless protected by a fleet. Their lack of armament means that they can not maintain combat for long periods, which seeing as this is a dreadnought, isn’t good. 



In terms of beginning the pursuit, I don’t think mistakes where made. The only ones I can think of is not sending more fighters or leaving hyperspace closer. 



Resistance 


Oh where do I begin.


Now I haven't played empire of war but I’ve played games like risk, and other strategy games and man was it easy to see the sheer low IQ military decisions made by the resistance. 



-Using these bomber things 


Let me start by saying the starfortress isn’t too much of a bad idea. These would be heavily ideal for bombing a area with little AA weapons nearby. However for hitting moving targets protected by a large fighter squadron, not so much. The SFs were used instead of Y wings, which would in this case easily out maneuver the SFs and be able to reach the target faster. But whatever, maybe they couldn’t afford y wings and this is all they had but let’s move on.



-Keeping a tight formation 


Do I need to explain this? We saw all except one of the bombers get shredded due to this close formation, so that’s easy to explain.



-Poe’s mission


What was the point of taking the PD guns out. This was a waste of time and effort taking them out, and well we see these guns wouldn’t make a diffrance in the long run. What the resistance should have done was send Poe in with like 2 other X wings loaded with protons, and just do a large scale bombing onto the bottom autocannons. Bam. No immediate threat of the fleet being destroyed. Simple as that.



-Leia’s regret 


Assuming this plan was given a go ahead by Leia or was made by her, why did she suddenly say “good job for risking your life Poe and also an dying, not head back to the ship so we can warp!” What caused her sudden change in plans, why not notify him to get him back to the ship. Then she acts all suprised when he does carry out the plan and even demotes him, despite her approving this, knowing the stakes and possibly even her making this plan.


-All fighters entering the hangar



We know that the X and maybe A wings are capable of going to hyperspace, so why did they dock? What was the point of it? I can get some fighters docking however not all of them, and we see later on this decision causes the destruction of all fighters aboard the MC. They should have left some fighters out to jump first and make sure the area is secure and protect the ships.


-Diverting all power to aft shields 


The resistance likely knew that fighters were coming and dropping shields at a specific point would allow them to enter the ship and do damage to the hull. Despite this, they still put all shield power to the aft, which caused the destruction of the hangar and killed most of the ships higher ups.",saltierthancrait,"a list of hopefully evrey flaw and tactical mistake made by the first order and resistance during the evacuation scene and the start of the chase tfo

Thrawn gets sent bye-bye to who-knows-where around 25 years before the Remnants of the Empire flee to the Unknown Regions to create the First Order, and there's lots of stuff in the books to show that Thrawn is very aware of beings that don't need navigation computers to traverse Hyperspace. Thrawn's ships get transported as well when he is taken, and the Remnants of The Empire only knew where to go because the coordinates were sent to them (via Palatine's secret plan or some shit).

Some might say that Poe should have died on Jakku. This was the original intent for the character according to JJ Abrams, but Isaac successfully advocated for himself to play a larger role. Evidently, he was a huge Star Wars fan in his youth, who dressed as Gonk droid for Halloween.

1. The New Republic collapses entirely. Just ceases to exist. 

2. The First Order rises to power, taking over the entire galaxy, and is then soundly defeated.

3. Rey Palpatine goes from never having heard of the Force to being a Jedi Knight.

4. Kylo Ren goes from Snoke's enforcer to Supreme Leader of the First Order to a willing servant of Palpatine to a redeemed Ben Solo.

5. Hux goes from a willing mass murderer to a would-be defector to the Resistance.

6. The Resistance destroys the First Order's most powerful weapon, is reduced to a handful of members, then rebuilds itself to its former strength.

7. The galaxy at large goes from ignoring the First Order, to being completely cowed by the First Order, to willing to rise up en masse to defeat the First Order at its most powerful.

8. Kylo Ren goes from willing to kill his father to being unwilling to kill his mother and from being fanatically devoted to Snoke to willing to kill Snoke. (this happens in the first week)

9. Rey and Kylo go from hating each other to loving each other to hating AND loving each other (this also happens in that first week). 

10. Palpatine comes back to life with a fleet of Death Star ISDs which are then all destroyed. (this happens in the last week)

11. Finn goes from a brainwashed child soldier to joyfully killing Stormtroopers to being in a coma to in love with Rose to not in love with Rose to maybe Force-sensitive? He also goes from joining the Resistance to being a general in the Resistance.

12. Poe goes from the hero of the Battle of Starkiller Base to being demoted in disgrace to leading a mutiny to regaining his former status to being promoted to general, then it turns out he used to be a drug dealer.

13. Leia goes from not having been a Jedi Knight to having been a Jedi Knight all along. 

14. Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO literally have no development or real involvement in the plot whatsoever.

Unfortunately, Squadrons for PC is just the latest in a long line of messy, poorly-planned and glitchy launches that alienate the players *most likely to support future titles like this*. If smaller studios can support HOTAS devices with no issues, there's no excuse for a AAA game not to work reliably with them *and* controllers.

This isn't even out of touch business leaders selling to a market they've no personal experience with, it's a systemic failure to grasp the basic principles of knowing and working for your audience. Bandai's *Ace Combat 7* was guilty of this at first by limiting HOTAS support to its own branded hardware, until it allowed flight stick support to be patched in later. 

It's still far from perfect and you need to adjust config files rather than remap in-game, but the fact that such business decisions are still being made boggles the mind and speaks to a broken culture behind the entire industry. But because these are such beloved IPs and will be good cash grabs in the very short term, I fear there's no incentive to change things up.",saltierthancrait,"shamus young several years ago seriously the man is a prophet and sadly may be taken as seriously as the biblical ones ea keeps getting blindsided with these disastrous product launches ubisoft and activision are far from perfect but note how they don’t seem to have this same inability to judge public reaction before a product launches having it happen once is understandable having it happen twice is unfortunate but having it happen again and again suggests a complete blindness to what the market wants

All the cutscenes are prerendered. So instead of being in them, you just look at them in the size of a normal ""computer monitor"" when in VR.

In the Tie Fighter cockpit you are pretty far away from the window in front of you and all your controls reach rather far into your sight.

I recommend standing up and go forward to adjust your position ""manually"".

The player character doesn't really move with your headset, so in the standard position you look at your empty neck anyways.

Also the size of everything seems a bit too small.

The Xwing cockpit is better, but one of my big problems is, you can't use your normal VR controller with Squadrons. So you have to either use your keyboard and mouse while seeing not much, or a Joystick. There isn't the fun of actually clicking things in the cockpit with your finger like other flight games in VR do. It's a bit immersion breaking.

Of course 3D works best with stuff that is close. If it's far away there is not much plasticity. Of course most things in a space flight games are rather far away. So maybe that's the reason.

Abrams famously held a TED talk about 'Mystery Boxes'. In it he explains how the anticipation of finding out what's inside a box is better than the eventual payoff.  

This has a place, but it's not in Star Wars.  

The film Cloverfield is a good example of where it works. The entire movie is supposed to be a mysterious invasion from the point of view of a few regular people. Explaining the mystery in that would be unrealistic. Leaving the audience in the shadows together with the audience is a fantastic idea.

Now there's Star Wars. A very lore-driven franchise. While the old EU did suffer from wanting to over-explain every little scrap of story (which is a writing technique I dislike), the movies themselves never decided to leave something as major as a villain in the shadows for us to figure it out.

I feel a mystery box can work well in two different settings:  
Horror settings and in stories where that character isn't the main focus.  

Giving us scraps to piece together the plot of a horror flick is very interesting. Giving us characters or settings that seem mysterious and giving only a handful of hints is exciting.  
GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask all have a satisfying story, but are also filled with mysteries and secrets. These add to the story and keep you thinking about it long after the story is finished.  

Do we really need confirmation that Francis Sinclair is a time traveler in Red Dead Redemption 2? No, it's better to leave it up to our imagination.  

What's also important in a good mystery box is that we're given clues. Nothing too concrete, but enough to let us speculate. Why do we see something fall from the sky into the water during the epilogue of Cloverfield? Well use the clues and figure it out!  
Why do the Moon Children in Majora's Mask resemble the Happy Mask Salesman, and why does the salesman vanish during the ending cutscene? Well that's for you to decide!

It's now an utterly terrible idea to make ships like Star Destroyers.

A fleet of Star Destroyers each equipped with a mini-Death Star laser that can destroy an entire planet. 

* The laser can be mounted on a ship that is only 25% bigger than a standard Star Destroyer.

* The laser itself is relatively small in comparison to the ship. Xystons still had all the other features of a typical Star Destroyer. 

* The laser is simply powered by the ships reactor. The  reactor also powered other things, so presumably it doesn't even need to be that big in the first place.

* The Weakness of attacking the Laser to destroy the whole ship only works because they have no shields. 

* The laser couldn't have been that difficult to manufacture overall. Because Palpatine makes either at least 1000, or 10,000 of them depending on which source you read. In secret. Without proper supply lines that the Empire had. Away from the rest of the galaxy and with no indication of any sort of manufacturing hubs, shipyards, space stations etc. It took a few years but presumably they didn't go intro production *immediately* after ROTJ.


So the technology for that super powerful weapon now exists in the Star Wars setting. Something which seems to have no significant hindrances to making it or special aspects that are required. Something that is capable of destroying stationary or slow moving targets in a single shot (that only lasts a few seconds), up to the size of a planet, with little effort.

It doesn't need a special ship design that's built entirely around the laser or something like that because it's just stuck on a slightly larger very common ship design. It doesn't seem to need special resources to make or use because there's so many of them. It doesn't appear to need certain conditions to use it because they just turn up at Kijimi and fire in just a few seconds. There isn't even any indication they're very, very expensive. It's just a big laser that can be used normally and it's treated like it's not that big a deal in general.

 Design a ship to make the best use of the the laser rather than just sticking it on a Star Destroyer, and suddenly laser ship vs laser ship will be the only thing that's feasible because anything without one is at a huge disadvantage, while the combat itself will just be whoever can fire first wins.   Capital ship without the laser? Now there's no advantages to that as it'll just lose to a laser in one hit. Ship with a laser? Also a terrible idea because it has the same weakness, difference is it might be able to fire first and win. Either way, Capital ships are invalidated. Especially with their other counter of the ""Holdo Maneuver"" which is used twice in the movies. 

It isn't like the Death Star or Legends Eclipse super star destroyer where they were rare and weren't going to be showing up all over the place. There is nothing to indicate these can't now just become fairly standard weaponry mounted on other capital ships - because that's what it is in RoS.

It's not rare, it's not difficult, it's manufactured as just another Starship weapon. Why would anyone now make or use a capital ship or a space station when that technology exists?

Between that and the ""Holdo Maneuver"", Planetary defenses are invalidated, Space Stations are useless, capital ships are obsolete and having a fleet of ships together is a bad idea. Anything that isn't a small ship with just a hyperdrive, or a ship with the super laser, is now completely useless. Space Combat in Star Wars has been completely and utterly ruined.

We hadn't seen Luke at all in the marketing for this film, and it seemed impossible that Disney would keep the biggest SW hero out of the promotion for the franchise's big return. My thinking then was that Luke was there the whole time, we just didn't know it. He had followed the path of his father to a T, as the Cave on Dagobah hahd predicted. Now he was terrorizing the Galaxy, and the new hope to stop him would be Rey (his daughter with Mara Jade who'd been hidden away for safety). The name even hinted at this (I thought), with Ky-=Sky, -Lo=Luke. Was it derivative? Abso-friggin-lutely. Did it make sense for Luke to fall to the Dark Side after ROTJ? Not really. And what about the actual other acyor listed as playing Ren? I just wrote Adam Driver off as doing the physical acting/some voice stuff while Mark would be him in other scenes. Keep in mind I was only 13 when TFA came out so I was fairly new to the internet fan theory game, and wasn't abreast of every scrap of new info about this movie. So yeah, pretty short-sighted and not exactly a great path for Luke in the new movies. 

However....

It made a lot more sense than what we got. I'd buy Luke turning to the Dark Side for what he sees as the greater good (maybe like in Dark Empire where he tries to destroy it from within but slowly falls under its influence) over him becoming a miserable reclusive failure who abandoned all his friends and family. And at least it would have had a plan for what Rey's origins were (something not even the actual filmmakers had). And it could have set up an amazing Luke v. Leia fight instead of an overpowered Mary Sue kicking the crap out of the villain in movie 1.

224,Flashbacks and Visions,24,j3kzce,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j3kzce/flashbacks_and_visions/,6,1601628521.0,"One thing I've noticed that I haven't really seen discussed or mentioned before is how the sequels use flashbacks and visions. Correct me if I am wrong but I don't remember any flashbacks or visions that transported the viewers to a new place in any of the original six films. It is something that has been bothering me for a while and I couldn't quite put my finger on why. When viewing the sequels it doesn't feel like Star Wars because of these constant flashbacks and visions that characters see. For instance when Luke talks about how Leia was a Jedi during TROS they actually show it, where as when Obi-Wan talks about the Clone Wars to Luke they don't show it. Obviously there is quite a real life time difference between the two and they could do much more technically in TROS, however in doing so it feels less like the Star Wars I grew up with. 

All this accomplishes is another form of dissociation from the original 6 George Lucas films. George didn't want there to be flashbacks so there would be some mystique behind the actions of the past, but the sequel trilogy discarded that. Take TLJ for example, they continually show the same scene where Luke betrays Ben, but from different viewpoints each time. The same thing could have been accomplished without actually showing the events, they could have simply described them just as every other Star Wars film has done. However they needed to because without actually showing Luke trying to murder his nephew nobody would have believed it.

Additionally the visions that are seen in the sequels transport us to an entirely different scene (Rey taking the lightsaber, Rey falling into the dark side pit) which is nothing like the visions other characters receive. For example Luke sees himself in Vader's helmet on Dagobah and Anakin sees his mother and Padme dying in his dreams. Again this just separates the original movies from the sequels. Don't get me started on Kylo's vision of Han too (he's a memory but he can talk and forgive you, and you can see him. B.S.). To sum it up I feel that along with the myriad of writing mistakes the sequel writers made they were forced to actually show the actions of people in flashbacks because if they didn't viewers would have never believed the things that happened in the past.",saltierthancrait,flashbacks and visions one thing ive noticed that i havent really seen discussed or mentioned before is how the sequels use flashbacks and visions correct me if i am wrong but i dont remember any flashbacks or visions that transported the viewers to a new place in any of the original six films it is something that has been bothering me for a while and i couldnt quite put my finger on why when viewing the sequels it doesnt feel like star wars because of these constant flashbacks and visions that characters see for instance when luke talks about how leia was a jedi during tros they actually show it where as when obiwan talks about the clone wars to luke they dont show it obviously there is quite a real life time difference between the two and they could do much more technically in tros however in doing so it feels less like the star wars i grew up with  this accomplishes is another form of dissociation from the original 6 george lucas films george didnt want there to be flashbacks so there would be some mystique behind the actions of the past but the sequel trilogy discarded that take tlj for example they continually show the same scene where luke betrays ben but from different viewpoints each time the same thing could have been accomplished without actually showing the events they could have simply described them just as every other star wars film has done however they needed to because without actually showing luke trying to murder his nephew nobody would have believed it the visions that are seen in the sequels transport us to an entirely different scene rey taking the lightsaber rey falling into the dark side pit which is nothing like the visions other characters receive for example luke sees himself in vaders helmet on dagobah and anakin sees his mother and padme dying in his dreams again this just separates the original movies from the sequels dont get me started on kylos vision of han too hes a memory but he can talk and forgive you and you can see him bs to sum it up i feel that along with the myriad of writing mistakes the sequel writers made they were forced to actually show the actions of people in flashbacks because if they didnt viewers would have never believed the things that happened in the past,1,2311,406,1,0.126,0.792,0.082,-0.9777

For better or worse, the films are now Star Wars history. Few films have inspired such polarized reactions, and several novels’ worth of criticism has been written about the sequels over the past half-decade. While I am not using this post to debate the merits of the sequel trilogy, I am going to argue that one key plot element was intentionally omitted relatively late in the production of the trilogy, and hastily buried by the producer, writers, and directors. A plot element which, if followed through with, would have altered the Star Wars universe forever.

One of the most common criticisms of the sequel trilogy is that it is a lazy rehash of the original trilogy, recycling similar plot points for the sake of cheap nostalgia. In The Force Awakens, this is readily apparent, as the film follows A New Hope almost beat-for-beat. However, for the rest of the trilogy, this gets muddier. There are some plot elements in The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker that are similar to those in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but to brand them a rehash isn’t completely accurate. Notably, the sequels are missing a big reveal, the kind that would define the entire trilogy the way “I am your father” changed cinema.

Now, you might be thinking that Rey’s “\[Your parents\] were nobody” is the reveal the sequel trilogy was preparing us for. While that’s definitely a key reveal (along with the additional revelation that she is descended from Palpatine), it isn’t of the same magnitude as “I am your father”. It seems like an unresolved plot thread, because it *is* an unresolved plot thread, for reasons I am about to explain. 

Indeed, this is not the only unresolved plot thread in the sequel trilogy. We never are given a clear explanation for why Ben Solo joined the dark side. Luke considers killing his nephew because he sees the darkness within him, doesn’t finish the job, and then Ben Solo becomes Kylo Ren. Why? Did he turn evil because Luke tried to kill him, or did Luke try to kill him because he was going to turn evil? This seems like a “chicken or the egg?” scenario, and doesn’t make sense for something that is as glossed over as it was. But a more shocking discovery about Kylo Ren would make his fall, and Luke’s attempt at murder, suddenly make a lot more sense. It would be, dare I say it, fantastic storytelling by JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson.

The rabbit hole goes deeper. In The Force Awakens, we learn that Han Solo left Leia following Ben’s fall to the dark side. This raises so many questions: Why would Han abandon Leia, the love of his life, during such a hard time? Why would Han abandon Ben, his own flesh and blood, to darkness? Why would Han (and Chewbacca) go back to *smuggling*?

What if Leia turned out to not be the love of Han’s life he thought she was? What if Han wasn’t abandoning *his* own flesh and blood? What if smuggling was the only way to reclaim something that his greatest rival had not taken from him? These questions, and those before it, have a simple answer.

Kylo Ren’s father is Jabba the Hutt. 

The explanation is simple. While Jabba’s prisoner on Tatooine, Leia had a moment of weakness and gave herself to the powerful Hutt crime lord. Perhaps it was even the will of the Force that the two should know each other in the biblical sense and conceive a child (ironically, “Will of the Force” was a heavily speculated title for Episode IX). Her choking him to death would be retconned to have been some kind of kink that Jabba was into. Because even with her lover dead, Leia would always have someone to remember him by.

Thematically, this fits into the sequel trilogy quite well. “Let the past die, kill it if you have to” aren’t just empty words for the trailers and marketing material, they are a cry for help from a man grappling with his very origins. A man who, upon learning of his true parentage, rejected his past, his birthright, and his family’s teachings of the Force. Indeed, Kylo is now a much more tragic figure, and has a reason to be an angsty mess beyond “muh dark side”.

Supreme Leader Snoke, rather than being a weak and pointless re-hash of Emperor Palpatine, would have been the mastermind who successfully put a wedge in the Skywalker family. How he would know about Kylo’s true parentage is anyone’s guess, but Jabba had a sizeable entourage in his palace. It’s not hard to imagine some Ithorian blabbed about it at the Cantina or something, and word spread from there.

This also allows for a richer thematic contrast between Rey and Kylo Ren. Kylo *wishes* his parents were no one, which fuels his antagonism (but also admiration) towards Rey. Meanwhile, both Rey and Kylo are descended from villains that were thought to have died in the final chapter of the previous trilogy. “Somehow, Palpatine returned”, like the Lucas dialogue of old, is overly literal but allows for clear thematic contrast. Despite all the things limiting romance between the princess and the Hutt, *somehow, Jabba returned*. This all illustrates how “No one’s ever really gone” is literal in the case of Rey/Palpatine, and figurative in the case of Kylo/Jabba.

In the final chapter of the trilogy, Kylo’s relationships with Han and Leia would be resolved. Isn’t the scene of Kylo hallucinating and communicating with Han’s spirit much more meaningful if it is not only his atonement for Han’s murder, but also his acceptance that Han was (as the man who raised him) his true father? And I am certain that were it not for Carrie Fisher’s early passing, she would have been fantastic in a scene where Kylo came to accept his mother’s love despite her proclivity for scoundrels. ;)

Interspecies romance is also now a confirmed part of the Star Wars universe, beginning with The Force Awakens. Maz Kanata refers to Chewbacca as her “boyfriend”, and a later scene depicts Chewbacca with a Resistance nurse that is bandaging him and commenting on how “brave” the Wookiee is. Nothing really is meant to come of this, but it does shift the audience’s expectations just enough to conceive of a human/Hutt romantic relationship. The following film then subverts those expectations in a shocking yet meaningful way.

The evidence is all there that in earlier drafts of the sequel trilogy, Jabba the Hutt was intended to be revealed as Kylo Ren’s true father. So, why didn’t Disney go through with this? Well, it’s obvious that a human/Hutt romance would be divisive among the fanbase, and if you think the company that made a Han Solo fanfic movie would be the one to truly subvert Star Wars, then you haven’t been paying attention. I would not envy Pablo Hidalgo and friends having to defend *that* on Twitter. But it’s pretty clear that this was the plan as late as pre-production for The Last Jedi, whose script is widely speculated to have been shuffled around (likely to account for the Jabba/Leia arc being struck down). Rian Johnson wanted to make a bold, subversive film, but was handicapped by Kathleen Kennedy, who twisted his arm into making the nonsensical, dramatically inert sequel we got. Abrams continued the story he and Rian set out to tell, but without that connective tissue of Jabba and Leia’s relationship to drive the story, it was a similar jumbled mess.

This extends beyond the sequel trilogy and into other Star Wars stories that Disney is using to build their universe. Admittedly this next part is pure speculation, but I believe this ties in with The Mandalorian as well. There is a lot of speculation as to the true nature of Baby Yoda (aka The Child). My own theory is that Baby Yoda has a piece of information that makes him dangerous to others. Could he be aware of Kylo Ren’s true parentage, and the survival of Jabba’s seed? That’s definitely knowledge the remnants of the Empire (which we know become the First Order) would not want getting out.

The threads are all there for a huge reveal that would rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise, but there’s nothing to tie the bow. Jabba and Leia “tie the bow”, and deliver us the rich, thematic, subversive sequel trilogy we hoped we would get when it was announced almost eight years ago.",saltierthancrait,kylo ren’s parentage and the twist that wasn’t an analysis it is 2020 and the sequel trilogy has come and gone for better or worse the films are now star wars history few films have inspired such polarized reactions and several novels’ worth of criticism has been written about the sequels over the past halfdecade while i am not using this post to debate the merits of the sequel trilogy i am going to argue that one key plot element was intentionally omitted relatively late in the production of the trilogy and hastily buried by the producer writers and directors a plot element which if followed through with would have altered the star wars universe forever of the most common criticisms of the sequel trilogy is that it is a lazy rehash of the original trilogy recycling similar plot points for the sake of cheap nostalgia in the force awakens this is readily apparent as the film follows a new hope almost beatforbeat however for the rest of the trilogy this gets muddier there are some plot elements in the last jedi and the rise of skywalker that are similar to those in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi but to brand them a rehash isn’t completely accurate notably the sequels are missing a big reveal the kind that would define the entire trilogy the way “i am your father” changed cinema you might be thinking that rey’s “your parents were nobody” is the reveal the sequel trilogy was preparing us for while that’s definitely a key reveal along with the additional revelation that she is descended from palpatine it isn’t of the same magnitude as “i am your father” it seems like an unresolved plot thread because it is an unresolved plot thread for reasons i am about to explain  this is not the only unresolved plot thread in the sequel trilogy we never are given a clear explanation for why ben solo joined the dark side luke considers killing his nephew because he sees the darkness within him doesn’t finish the job and then ben solo becomes kylo ren why did he turn evil because luke tried to kill him or did luke try to kill him because he was going to turn evil this seems like a “chicken or the egg” scenario and doesn’t make sense for something that is as glossed over as it was but a more shocking discovery about kylo ren would make his fall and luke’s attempt at murder suddenly make a lot more sense it would be dare i say it fantastic storytelling by jj abrams and rian johnson rabbit hole goes deeper in the force awakens we learn that han solo left leia following ben’s fall to the dark side this raises so many questions why would han abandon leia the love of his life during such a hard time why would han abandon ben his own flesh and blood to darkness why would han and chewbacca go back to smuggling if leia turned out to not be the love of han’s life he thought she was what if han wasn’t abandoning his own flesh and blood what if smuggling was the only way to reclaim something that his greatest rival had not taken from him these questions and those before it have a simple answer ren’s father is jabba the hutt  explanation is simple while jabba’s prisoner on tatooine leia had a moment of weakness and gave herself to the powerful hutt crime lord perhaps it was even the will of the force that the two should know each other in the biblical sense and conceive a child ironically “will of the force” was a heavily speculated title for episode ix her choking him to death would be retconned to have been some kind of kink that jabba was into because even with her lover dead leia would always have someone to remember him by this fits into the sequel trilogy quite well “let the past die kill it if you have to” aren’t just empty words for the trailers and marketing material they are a cry for help from a man grappling with his very origins a man who upon learning of his true parentage rejected his past his birthright and his family’s teachings of the force indeed kylo is now a much more tragic figure and has a reason to be an angsty mess beyond “muh dark side” leader snoke rather than being a weak and pointless rehash of emperor palpatine would have been the mastermind who successfully put a wedge

They are all so cartoonishly dark and depressing.

-Anakin: Has his sacrifice invalidated, and his children are tormented till their dying days by the evil badtard who ruined HIS life and enslaved the whole galaxy. 

-Luke: forgot all the lessons he learned in the OT overnight, creating a monster worse than Vader out of his nephew, and his academy fell apart and he abandoned the galaxy to become a bitter old recluse who accomplished all of one barely heroic thing in his last few years, and never got to see his best friend again. Oh, and apparently his old masters could have shown up at anytime to help him with Ben/ warn him that the Emperor is still alive, bit instead only show up to belittle and mock him.

-Leia: kicked out of the ridiculously incompetent New Republic for being Vader's Daughter (despite Leia not knowing herself until eve of the final battle, and being a loyal rebellion leader since her teens), has her only son turn to the dark side due to her brother's failure to teach, and was ditched by said brother and her husband. Spent the last years of her life leading an obscenely underequipped rebellion, (after the government she slaved to restore and run fell overnight) and dies trying from ""forcing too hard"" to save her spoiled brat of a son.

-Han: Only son turned evil, and (like Luke) Han forgot everything he learned in the OT to ditch his wife and become a smuggler (and a hilariously incompetent one at that). Dies trying to save his son, and without ever getting a chance to see his best friend again.

-Lando: Lost his daughter to an enemy faction he'd risked everything to destroy, and spent over a decade on a miserable desert wasteland that none of his friends apparently bothered to check up on him at.

-Chewie:Watches as all his friends fail at everything they try before finally giving up and dying, and is saddled with being the pet sidekick to a punk who basically showed up and stole all their shit (including the ship that should be HIS after Han's death).

-R2 & 3PO: R2 is left out of the action, and is only ever around to see how old and pathetic his former master has become, and to see the woman he's been with since birth die sad and alone. 3PO could be removed from 2/3 films with no consequence, and spends the last one as the punching bag of a group of yahoos he barely knows. They don't even get to be the last characters on-screen in a SW movie (despite being the first) since Miss pretty-little-perfect rEy sKyWaLkEr has to steal that too. 

It's inevitable that things wouldn't have been perfect after ROTJ in a Sequel trilogy, but they went overboard in making it depressing. It's ridiculous to say that nothing our heroes accomplished mattered, and to have it all be destroyed so quickly. Happy endings can happen in real life too. My grandfather has passed on, but he was able to do it peacefully and surrounded by family, after making sure they could live in comfort after he was gone. He led a happy, fulfilling life.

""The OT is full of plot holes and things that were never explained""

What defenders seem to forget is that the OT was a blank slate, giving George Lucas enough room to change the story as much as possible. He was involved in all key decisions, meaning that the story was told from one perspective/at the bare minimum, coherent between films. 

This is much different to having 6 films to follow up and then having two directors actively try to erase the previous film's ideas.

Also, nobody acts like the Prequels/OT were perfect. We shouldn't ignore problems with the Sequels just because they did something wrong here or there - that's not arguing against the flaws of the ST, just dismissing them.

Subtracting that number from the currently accepted age of the universe (13.799 billion years), then subtracting 300 million years for the assumed age of the universe at the start of galaxy formation, gets a 0 BBY date of 399,000,000 BC (give or take a few million years), during the early Devonian period, Emsian stage. That's about the same time as the formation of Alpha Lacertae. That's definitely a LONG time ago. ""

Since galactic history stops being recorded after 141 ABY in the EU, I can't help but imagine a dead galaxy. No more politics, no more hyperspace lanes/trade, and NO more Jedi or Sith. Coruscant is in ruins, possibly charred and caked in ashes. The galaxy is vacant. Just the Whills in some pocket dimension while R2 tells them about his adventures during the saga.

242,Am I the only one that is bothered by the fact that Rey is suppose to be our POV character in TFA yet we never see her reaction to finding out about the destruction of the Hosnian System or the existence of Starkiller Base in the movie?,98,j34ksf,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j34ksf/am_i_the_only_one_that_is_bothered_by_the_fact/,25,1601569097.0,"Seriously Rey was in the forest recovering from the vision she got from Anakin’s lightsaber when the Hosnian System was destroyed. We don’t see her look up in the sky and seeing the explosions. She does look up later but that’s when she sees the incoming FO ships not the exploding planets.

And then Kylo kidnaps her and the next scene we see her in she is strapped down to a chair next to Kylo. We don’t know if she was kept unconscious until then or if someone told her about the SKB or the destruction of the Hosnian System inbetween those scenes.

Later when she reunites with Han, Finn and Chewie we never see them telling her about that the planet they are on is a weapon capable of destroying planets and they it destroyed the Republic capital hours ago or that it just about to do it with the Resistance’s Base.

I find this to be very bizarre writing because Rey is suppose to be our POV character yet we don’t get to see her reaction to the things that occurs in the movie.

Imagine  a Bond movie were Cardiff, Edinburgh, Dublin and London gets nuked and we never see Bond’s reaction to it. Heck we don’t even get to see any scenes tabt indicates that he was even aware of that it happened before the movie’s end.

Wouldn’t that be weird?

I know a lot of Star Wars' soundtrack (and I know even more about the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, but that's a whole other story), but I know very little about the soundtrack of the sequels.   
But then again I'm not writing this to be graded by a musicology professor. It's an internet post I thought up in the shower and decided to write up around 12AM


SO  
Let's talk about leitmotifs! What is a leitmotif? Well, a leitmotif is a recurring piece of music that is often associated with a person, location, faction or idea.  
The simplest example of a leitmotif is Darth Vader's theme: [The Imperial March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8)  
You instantly recognize what this theme represents: darkness. It has been used over and over again throughout the franchise. [Including this 'Imperial Anthem' featured in Star Wars: Rebels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TouCl6yp13A)

A great leitmotif isn't just recognizable, it's _variable_.  

Let's talk about Rey's theme and Binary Sunset.  

[Binary Sunset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2W5YPQJqUs) is a recurring leitmotif featured throughout the entire Star Wars franchise.  
It symbolizes hope and those who fight for it. [This bit in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcZ9kQ1h-ZY) symbolizes the Force and the destiny of those bound by it.  

Its initial appearance is a hopeful, soft song. It plays when Luke Skywalker gazes out at the two suns of the desert planet of Tatooine. He ponders if there is more to life. He wants to see more of the galaxy.

This is quite similar to Rey's theme, [The Scavenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YcCLaTnBE). It too represents a young person who wants to see more of the galaxy. And it builds up in a similar way.

However, I feel Rey's theme isn't as variable as the Force theme.  
Rey's theme stays mostly stagnant throughout the trilogy. It's not a bad tune, but it doesn't change much. TLJ adds choir at some bits, and plays up the brass a bit more. But little else happens.  
This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is a bit boring.

Above I mentioned the Force theme, and how it has come to represent The Force and destiny in the Star Wars franchise. I think a good example of it would be [the ending theme of The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DczKNnP2XoQ). The theme still represents hope, but it has a more downcast, tragic tone to it. The theme has been changed and now gives a stronger emotion, fitting to the emotional final scenes of The Empire Strikes Back.

But that's not all. Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqqiUh1lec).  
This is the opening music to Revenge of the Sith. It is the same melody, but now played as a sonorous war fanfare, complete with war drums. It sets the mood for the impressive opening sequence perfectly.  

Not convinced yet?  
Well, remember the Imperial March?  
Here is [Anakin Skywalker's theme in the Phantom Menace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_rzI7Y_NUs).  

Now, this is obviously a very biased post. Of course it is. I can claim to be unbiased but then I would be lying.  
However, I feel like the sequels don't play around with their leitmotifs as much. If you've heard Rey's theme in The Force Awakens, you've heard it in the rest of the films.  
Kylo Ren doesn't even have a leitmotif. Just a 5-note brass section that plays every time he appears on screen.  
Rose Tico, strangely enough, does have a leitmotif. [And it's somehow one of the better tunes in the sequels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGBCZOaajys&list=PL1IbDEw68S5MOfe-CrPpx0TP0xlCCYHnQ&index=5). Which is kind of odd for such a minor character.

Overall, I don't think the music in the sequels is necessarily bad. But it is kinda bland and not very varied.  

And, to close off this post I'd like to post one of my personal favorite renditions of the Force theme  
[The ending theme to Attack of the Clones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLlS8i3sFWs)  
Which sounds ominous and dramatic, and then turns into my favorite rendition of the Imperial March to boot. It doesn't change much about the March itself, but those trumpets are perfection.",saltierthancrait,"is it just me or is the sequels music not incredibly variable im really not the best person to talk about this to be honest i know a lot of star wars soundtrack and i know even more about the pirates of the caribbean soundtrack but thats a whole other story but i know very little about the soundtrack of the sequels

He risked his career and his life to give them valuable information that could help them win the war. Then he even killed his own soldiers in order to rescue Han, Leia, and Chewie so they could escape. Would Han, Leia, or Chewie coldly kneecap the guy with a blaster shot and leave him to die after he just saved their lives? I can't see it. When they ask him why he's helping them, and he says it's because he hates Darth Vader personally and wants him to fail, does that justify them just leaving him to die? I mean, sure, that's a petty reason to be a mole for the Rebel Alliance and it's not like he cares about their cause. Him not being dedicated to their cause still doesn't change the fact that he helped them and risked his life to do it.

To me, Finn and Poe just leaving Hux to die (I won't involve Chewie in this decision since the Sequels treat him like a dog who can drive) proves the new characters not only aren't heroes, they can't even be called good people. You can argue Hux deserved it for all the things he did, and that Hux was just helping them to take down Kylo Ren not because he cared for the Resistance cause at all. So what? It still doesn't change the fact that they would have all been dead without him. It also shows how stupid they all are. Poe is supposed to be a military commander and he doesn’t see the strategic importance of taking Hux alive? Hux would be an extremely valuable prisoner for the Resistance. Defeating Palpatine at Exegol isn't the end of the war. The First Order still exists throughout the galaxy. General Hux would have tons of information about them they could use to take them all down.

You can say Finn was right to get some measure of revenge against the guy who programmed him in the First Order, but the thing is, heroes don't seek out petty revenge and coldly shoot people and leave them to die. Least of all someone who just saved them from certain death. That's what villains do, or anti-heroes. Finn isn't supposed to be an anti-hero, he's never once depicted that way until that moment. Even if you hated Hux and were glad about what Finn did to him, isn't that moment a betrayal of Finn as a character? Finn's whole story is supposed to be about him having too much compassion (because he's Force sensitive) that he needed to get away from a life of brutality. To have him shoot Hux - deliberately in a way that dooms him to be found out as the spy - and leave him to die is a pretty bad character regression for Finn.",saltierthancrait,the heroes left their reluctant ally to die after he just risked it all to save their lives imagine if a high ranking imperial officer was acting as a mole to aid the rebel alliance in return of the jedi he risked his career and his life to give them valuable information that could help them win the war then he even killed his own soldiers in order to rescue han leia and chewie so they could escape would han leia or chewie coldly kneecap the guy with a blaster shot and leave him to die after he just saved their lives i cant see it when they ask him why hes helping them and he says its because he hates darth vader personally and wants him to fail does that justify them just leaving him to die i mean sure thats a petty reason to be a mole for the rebel alliance and its not like he cares about their cause him not being dedicated to their cause still doesnt change the fact that he helped them and risked his life to do it me finn and poe just leaving hux to die i wont involve chewie in this decision since the sequels treat him like a dog who can drive proves the new characters not only arent heroes they cant even be called good people you can argue hux deserved it for all the things he did and that hux was just helping them to take down kylo ren not because he cared for the resistance cause at all so what it still doesnt change the fact that they would have all been dead without him it also shows how stupid they all are poe is supposed to be a military commander and he doesn’t see the strategic importance of taking hux alive hux would be an extremely valuable prisoner for the resistance defeating palpatine at exegol isnt the end of the war the first order still exists throughout the galaxy general hux would have tons of information about them they could use to take them all down can say finn was right to get some measure of revenge against the guy who programmed him in the first order but the thing is heroes dont seek out petty revenge and coldly shoot people and leave them to die least of all someone who just saved them from certain death thats what villains do or antiheroes finn isnt supposed to be an antihero hes never once depicted that way until that moment even if you hated hux and were glad about what finn did to him isnt that moment a betrayal of finn as a character finns whole story is supposed to be about him having too much compassion because hes force sensitive that he needed to get away from a life of brutality to have him shoot hux  deliberately in a way that dooms him to be found out as the spy  and leave him to die is a pretty bad character regression for finn,1,2699,511,1,0.184,0.723,0.093,-0.9943

We know from *Brick*, *Looper*, and *Knives Out* that he actually has a decent grasp of character, motivation, and plot. And he did tell us straight up that his plan for TLJ was to make a polarizing movie. 

A lot of stuff in TLJ looks like incompetence or carelessness. But what if it was intentional? What if Holdo's behavior looks stupid because Rian wanted it to look stupid? What if Rose comes across as a psycho stalker because Rian wanted it that way? What if Canto Bight makes no sense because Rian wanted it to make no sense?

What if TLJ sent half the audience out of the theater wondering ""what the hell?"" because Rian wanted it that way?

""Really? Opening with a 'your mom' joke? How on earth did you imagine that was good writing?""

""Oh, I didn't. I wrote it that way on purpose because I knew it would piss people off. I wrote the whole movie that way. And it worked, too!""

I mean, nothing Rose says or does makes any sense. But in *Brick*, everything every character does makes total sense every step of the way. Even the characters who are acting irrationally, their actions make sense in the context of their situation. You can't tell me that the guy who wrote Brendan, Tugger, and Dode somehow wrote Rose the way she's written *by accident*. 

Anyway, that's my current working theory. We're *supposed* to think the pointless hacker bait and switch, and the stolen Spaceballs gag, are stupid. Rian wanted a polarizing movie, so he wrote a *filtering* movie. 

Like how email scammers send emails that are full of grammatical errors and other obvious silliness. They don't want to waste effort on smart people who are going to figure out a clever scam. So they filter out the smart people right away. Only people who don't see anything suspicious in that Nigerian prince's story continue on to get scammed. 

Same thing here. Half the audience sees the many stupid stupid problems with the movie, and hate it. The other half of the audience thinks the jokes are funny and the visuals are amazing and the beats land with a good tempo, and they like the movie. Boom. The audience is polarized.

As a kid, I was absolutely enamoured by the movies. I did grow to be critical of them in ways I think are deserved but overall I still think they’re pretty good. As an adult I grew to appreciate the original trilogy as the cinematic masterpieces they are, enriched by the knowledge of Anakin’s past. 

When TFA came out, it seemed very appealing to me. I hated that they killed Han Solo, but I accepted it. I have to admit I was subconsciously trying my best to ignore details like Chewie being ignored by Leia afterwards, as well as a few other awkward and discomforting details, because I wanted to preserve the nostalgia trip I was getting from it all.

TLJ, I really didn’t hate either. I thought most of it was really visually fantastic, and, once again I was almost willingly looking the other way from the things I disliked about it. Except when Rey didn’t join with Kylo, like she obviously should have if you asked me. It’s simply the tactically smart decision. That part I couldn’t ignore, but hey, I didn’t write the damn thing, so I decided to go along with it. 

Then I finally watched TROS. And holy mother of god, I don’t know how they could have fucked things up much worse. I went into it with the same suspension of disbelief I had for the other two. It was immediately shattered by “The Dead Speak”. I’m sorry what?? Palpatine came back somehow? That’s the stupidest, most BS thing I’ve ever heard. That’s like some seriously low B-movie crap. No, let’s forget about forging Kylo Ren into a legitimate villain. Oh and Snoke, who I genuinely liked as a villain, was actually just a phantom of Palpatine. Why don’t you take the few good things you actually did and just shit all over them? Not to mention the lore written by Lucas himself. 

Honestly I wanted to shut it off then and there, and I almost wish I had, if not for the fact it would have kept me awake until I powered through the rest. And what a god awful steaming pile of garbage. The Palpatine reveal with Kylo. Gag me. The beacon thing leading to him that obviously should have been a fucking holocron. Why would you create a new lore thing when there is an existing lore thing that serves that exact purpose?? The “force healing”. The battle at the end. 

Is there a drug I can take or a procedure to make me forget the whole trilogy like in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?”

Exact quote from the blue excerpt about Vader

""Vader completed his meditation and opened his eyes. His pale, flame-savaged face stared back at him from out of the reflective black transparisteel of his pressurized meditation chamber. Without the neural connection to his armor, he was conscious of the stumps of his legs, the ruin of his arms, the perpetual pain in his flesh. He welcomed it. Pain fed his hate, and hate fed his strength. Once, as a Jedi, he had meditated to find peace. Now he meditated to sharpen the edges of his anger.

...


Drawing on the Force, he activated the automated arm. It descended and the helmet and faceplate wrapped his head in metal and plasteel, the shell in which he existed. He welcomed the spikes of pain when the helmet's neural needles stabbed into the flesh of his skull and the base of his spine, unifying his body, mind, and armor to form an interconnected unit. 


When man and machine were one, he no longer felt the absence of his legs or arms, the pain of his flesh, but the hate remained, and the rage still burned. Those, he never relinquished, and he never felt more connected to the Force than when his fury burned.""",saltierthancrait,"essay about marey sue i recently left a discord that apparently had the argument about rey so often that they decided to write an essay and post a google document every time the discussion comes up so figured id screenshot it the best i could and let yall thumb through it  a mary sue  quote from the blue excerpt about vader completed his meditation and opened his eyes his pale flamesavaged face stared back at him from out of the reflective black transparisteel of his pressurized meditation chamber without the neural connection to his armor he was conscious of the stumps of his legs the ruin of his arms the perpetual pain in his flesh he welcomed it pain fed his hate and hate fed his strength once as a jedi he had meditated to find peace now he meditated to sharpen the edges of his anger

Palpatine was Chancellor of the ruling government and Anakin was a Jedi sworn to defend the government he led and thus they were close enough to develop a friendship. But Snoke was hidden away in the Unknown Regions building an invasion force in secret and Ben was a Jedi on some reclusive planet. Without even getting into specifics, this relationship is already sounding bizarre because none should exist and then the writers don’t even give an explanation in the films either making this all the more puzzling. 

So when the books and comics finally have to explain this mess we get Snoke speaking to Ben in his head from across the galaxy for years on end. This raises even more questions because the force has never been shown to work like that and the question remains about how did nobody pick up on this and why didn’t Ben say anything.

265,Boba Fett and Captain Phamsa are NOT meaningfully comparable characters.,96,j2b3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j2b3e4/boba_fett_and_captain_phamsa_are_not_meaningfully/,15,1601452107.0,"I'm sure you've seen the argument of how Boba Fett also did very little in comparison to what was promised just like Phasma, but this is a false equivalence, and falls under the umbrella of trying to use past movie's flaws (which aren't even really flaws if you think about them) to excuse the ST's failings. 

On the issue of Boba and Phasma, yes they are both armored secondary antagonists who are meant to evoke a sense of mystery and awe, but when you look at the way both are actually used in the story, they become completely different. Boba, for all intent and purpose, is simply a way for the story to move forward, and look cool while doing it. He had some build-up in the merchandising for ESB, but not to the degree that Phasma did. It's not like a talented star of the biggest TV show at the time played him, and everyone working on it talked about how important and cool Fett was going to be when it came out. If Lee Majors or Telly Savalas had played Boba, and he didn't even get the dignity of capturing Han and escaping at the end, then the Phasma defenders might have a point. 

Boba's presence in the EU is responsible for a lot of his popularity, but it works to his benefit because it meshes well with what is established onscreen. His reputation as a dangerous hunter who everyone either respects or fears is enhanced by the various comics and novels. In Phasma's case, the EU stories CONTRADICT what is seen on-screen. Phasma's  scenes in TFA are either based around exposition unrelated to her, or show her as a coward even her former soldier's don't respect or fear. So it seems like the books are telling a totally different story when showing her as a tough badass.

Finally, when George realized people wanted more of Fett than he expected, he gave it to them. He made Jango Fett vital to the plot of AOTC (and by extension the rest of the saga) by being the template for the Clone Army that ultimately gave Palpatine victory and explored Boba's start of darkness in-depth in a few episodes of TCW. How did Rian and Lucasfilm respond to the criticism of wasting Phamsa when making TLJ? Give her just as little to do except be in one pointless fight scene that she dies at the end of.

Set right after the destruction of the 2nd death star, emperial and republic fighters go head to head, with republic fighters claiming the war is over.

Now this is what we would expect, the empire is not completely gone yet and further republic expedition must take place. But this idea of filling this time period hase been happening much more frequently, with content such as the Mandalorian and Battlefront II adding to this idea of further empire resistance after the death star 2 destruction. In both as we see, small insurgent groups of imperial soldiers attempt to rebuild what they can out of the empire, and this is gone into even more depth in BF2. This is the content we wanted to see in the ST, but were not given. But why are these new revelations and expansion happening now? Disney has clearly seen that they missed a long period of time when making the new trilogy, and I have some explanations for why these changes are happening.

Disney is looking to alter the canon. A little stretched of an outcome, but it is possible. They may not officially strike down the ST, but they will continue to build on the Empire and not on the First Order. The first order and the transition into it are not made clear in these creations, but ultimately Mandalorian S2 will seal the deal for the outcome of the ST. If they affirm that the Empire will transition into the First Order and attempt to ressurect Palps, all hope is lost.

Conversly, they may be looking to explain and add to what little they had regarding this time period. After Rotj, we knew that a new republic would form, one that would likely squash any resistance. And then all of a sudden it was insignificant, and destroyed within 5 minutes of its existence being announced. In this scenario, Disney may try to somehow make this possible. We'll see.

A character that begins as a slave, but is shown to be talented, skilled, humble and kind by nature.

This is Anakin’s backstory. This sounds like then perfect set up for an Ultimate “Mary Sue” character, doesn’t it? But where does the story go from there? 

All this potential power goes to Anakin’s head. Palpatine is well aware of this and uses it to draw Anakin further to the dark side. Anakin continually believes himself to be destined to destroy the Sith, making him reckless enough to attack Dooku, losing his hand in the process. He eventually becomes so obsessed with power that he tries to interfere with death itself...and ends up losing everything: his wife, his power, most of his body...even his very moral compass. 

Anakin starts as a character who seems to be set up to be a Mary Sue, yet he becomes a character who is as far away from a Mary Sue as it is possible to be. This in fact shows us the problem with Mary Sue characters; people who are brought up with the belief that they are naturally born superior to everyone do NOT grow up to be healthy or well-adjusted.

1. In the Novel Bloodlines; Leia claims she never trained as a Jedi outside of learning some meditation techniques. But in Episode 9, she was shown training in Lightsaber combat and even had her own Lightsaber.
2. Operation Cinder was enacted after Palpatine's death under the idea that ""an Empire who like their Emperor die should not be allowed to exist"" but yet Palpatine came back alive and its implied that he died before. Making Operation Cinder completely pointless and petty on Palpatine's end.
3. In Episode 9, Poe was said to be a spice smuggler (Spice is the SW word for drugs). But yet all books and source-guides prior has info that contradicts this notion.
4. The 2nd Death Star had a room to the left of Palpatine's throne that contains the Sith Dagger. But the area where the room is can't exist. In ROTJ, that area is a window that shows outer space.
5. Palaptine has claim to have 'died before', but this is never mention in the Prequels or TCW.
6. In the Episode 7 novel, Rey and Poe meet. But in Episode 8, they haven't met until the end of the movie.

DisWars is beyond convoluted and inconsistent. That mainly has to do with the fact that nobody in the current-Lucasfilm story group cares.

There, I said it.

This scene serves as nothing more than one giant, smarmy F.U. to the fans. The whole scene, I believe, is meant to be viewed through the lens of the fans being Jake, and Disney/Lucasfilm being Yoda. For example:

Jake says he’s going to burn down the sacred tree with the sacred texts, read: Us fans didn’t get our own way, so we’re going to burn Star Wars down.

Yoda essentially says go ahead, page turners they were not. A self explanatory dig at the old E.U.

Jake ultimately can’t do it, because us fans are just full of bluster and empty threats. 

Yoda then summons lightning from the sky to burn the tree down. Lucasfilm is god, and they’ll do as they please. Yoda then laughs at Jake, because he (Lucasfilm) is just so above all this silliness.

It turns out Rey had stolen the texts some time ago: The new fans own Star Wars now, deal with it you 50 year old neckbeard.

This all may seem a little tinfoil hat-y, but if it’s true, it’s disgraceful.

The characters doesn’t feel like real people they feel more like larpers.

Larpers are people that participate in Live Action Role Playing games were they can pretend to be a medieval princesses, cybernetic bounty hunters etc depending of the theme of the Larp.

As someone she who has witness some of those events one thing I notice is that since a lot of the players aren’t actually professional actors and also lacks a lot of real life personal experiences from the sorts of occupations their characters they pretend to play would have so hey  have a tendency not behave in a way that you would imagine a character they pretend to be would really act.

Also sometimes some larpers doesn’t even act at all and behave how they usually behave l

I think this is a good metaphor too describe the differences with how the characters behave in the DT compared to the rest of the Star Wars movies. 

In the previous SW movies for example soldiers behaved like soldiers. In the DT soldiers feels more like how people who have no experience at all of being soldiers imagine a soldier would act.

The same thing with the commanders.

If they were going to go that route, they really needed to focus on character development to get us invested in the story. But they didn't. So, no worldbuilding or character development? Ok, add some complexity. Involve some morally grey third parties in the conflict to make things interesting. No, they didn't really do that either. We get a basic war between two opposing factions, full of characters who aren't developed or given much motivations to be involved, and none of it is properly set up or even explained. Not even the opening crawl of TFA does much to tell us what is going on.

I suppose the Guavian Death Gang, Kanjiklub, and DJ (Benicio Del Toro) could be considered morally grey third parties, but they were all a bit “blink and you miss them.” They really needed someone to solidly represent the scoundrel perspective. The only attempt at this was with DJ, but he disappeared and we never hear from him again. It felt like another missed opportunity with a fantastic actor who could have done so much more than what he was given. Zorii Bliss in TROS originally seemed like she could be an interesting scoundrel figure, but she turns into just another bland good guy.

As much as I hated the Last Jedi, the War Profiteers at Canto Bight who were making money selling weapons *to both sides* was one of the few interesting takes that could have gone in an interesting direction. But it wasn’t explored at all and that whole subplot really only existed so ~~Rian Johnson~~ Rose Tico could lecture ~~the audience~~ Finn on why war and capitalism is bad. 

The Chiss Ascendency or the Hutt Clan making an appearance in the Sequels could have shaken things up a bit and made it more interesting. I guess I just would have liked any exploration of the political situation of the galaxy. They don’t tell us what has been going on in the 30+ years inter-war period. We didn't need a bunch of longwinded stuff about \~trade disputes\~, but just show us something, anything!

I think what made season one so good, for me anyways, was that it didn't include or rely on any old characters and it solely had new characters that were actually interesting and it had a good story/plot to work off of.

I feel like all of these ""returning"" characters, like Ahsoka, are going to be the ruining factor of season two, because they WILL outshine the main cast; Mando/Din, The Child, Cara, Greef, and Gideon. 

The only question I have is why the hell is Ahsoka even in this? {Well we all know the answer, god forbid if Ahsoka, the golden child, isn't in a work he (Dave Filoni) is a part of.} Shouldn't she be with walking Hot Topic trying to find or save the annoying ass kid and discount Mitth'raw'nuruodo from space whales? 

The only two returning characters that make sense, if they do return, are Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett, I guess. Luke is the obvious one sense he is, you know, ***The Last Jedi***, and highly relevant at this, and sense Mando/Din is trying to find a ***Jedi*** and not some random ass force-user. Boba makes sense to me, because out of all the ""returning"" characters, he was the last known one to encounter a Jedi, Luke, plus he may be the one going after Mando for the Imperial Remnant, sense he is the best bounty hunter in the galaxy at this time.  

Bo-Katan is kinda meh to me, because they will, most likely, explain what happened on Mandalore in more detail and the darksaber and how Moff Gideon acquired it. 

This is my personal opinion, not a fact. Always remember that.

I do not think Holdo was supposed to exist. I think Leia was supposed to do everything holdo did in the movie, and every single one of Holdos actions makes infinitely more sense if it is Leia.

I think that this is the real source of some of the movies biggest problems. I also think Disney is a bunch of sexist jerks, and that they expected that hiring Laura Dern, an actress people are nostalgic for... would make people instantly connect with the character.

Think about how the movie would have gone... Leia is injured, but is continuing command, Poe thinks that her injuries have led to her being mentally compromised... She refuses to tell Poe what is going on.

When its revealed what her plan is, it makes way more sense because Poe would have wanted to take her place and have been the one who heroically sacrifices himself.

Everything makes more sense if its Leia.

But they decide to not kill Leia in this movie. As a result they feel obligated to have Luke die, because they think they have to have one of the original trio die in each of the sequel trilogy films.

Anyway Luke Skywalker discovered Abeloth and set out to find and kill her with a bunch of Sith Lords that hid in the outer rim for a long time. Luke skywalker stabbed her with his green lightsaber but thinking she was dead the force let him know she was alive.

Abeloth mind trapped many Jedi and other force sensitive users and sucked their life energy from being in different areas. 

Abeloth death is still unknown because George Lucas never finished writing her for the expanded universe because he sold Lucasfilm to Disney and had no rights to Star Wars anymore. But that doesn’t mean JJ can’t use her and give her a epic death.

I dont have a lot right now, but the biggest ones surround TLJ, because that movie seems to short circuit peoples brains.

A bizarre number of people declared ""everyone can use the force now, now anyone can learn to use the force"" and ""now its no longer about bloodlines""

This is like, first there is a declaration that the previous movies said ""only certain families can use the force"" which has never been true... and its also not true that the movie made it so anyone could use the force. Its just a series of bizarre declarations about the Star Wars universe.

The ability to use the force is a rare gift, that people seem to get seemingly randomly, and can be inherited from the previous generation... That is the way it had always been, and TLJ did nothing to change that. And it was just a bizarre thing to say.

The second big one is everyone declaring that the moral of the movie is to ""burn the past and forget about it""

But like... Bro... that's the villain saying that, and the lesson that the hero (Rey) learns is that people who don't learn from the past end up making more mistakes. Like Kyle Ren is a crazy psychopath who just murdered someone and intended to murder more.

He... he is the bad guy at that point.

I swear to god these movies seem to short circuit peoples brains and they just say bizarre things that make no sense unless the person reviewing had never seen any other star wars movie before... or maybe never seen any other movie before?

Safe to say I was wrong. 

 I first heard of STC by seeing the posts on the other Star Wars subs, and the way they posted about this place misconstrued the narrative by claiming that the critics are haters on the cast and crew. And for a time, I believed them, especially during the time the movies were showing in theatres. After all, I did hear the quote, ""No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans."" (Which did not help.). I thought to myself, *That place seems like a toxic circlejerk!* 

It was not until rewatching the sequels and begun digging into this sub that I realised something was amiss. The more I rewatch the films, the more aware I became to the plot holes, poor character development, blatant disregard for previously established lore, the lack of even a decent outline for the story, and the poor treatment of the main actors. This escalated after watching the Youtube channel Thor Skywalker. 

As I browsed STC, I found myself agreeing with the criticisms. And now, I cannot look at the other subs anymore (I will not name those subs, but if you are a fellow salt miner like myself, you will know the ones I am referring to.). The fact that they condemn STC with unfair name calling and pointing fingers, just makes *them* look immature. 

But since I was on the other side, I will explain why they act this way: It is more out of denial than anything else. They don't realise that we, as fans of a franchise we grew up watching, we got screwed over by blind executives. Again. So what was that term?Sequel apologists? Yeah, that's the one. 

And now, at this point, I hate the story of the sequels so much, I am preparing to write an alternate version of the sequel story. There are some ideas that I am, quite frankly, shocked that no one has thought of before.

You are wrong.

Many sequel defenders say the following lines:

1. Rey has a great arc but your just sexist
2. Rey is not a Mary Sue and I’ve proven countless times that she is not.
3. Anakin is a Mary Sue as well, but you only target Rey because she is new
4. You must be like 12 years old to not know how Luke’s depression arc happened
5. Snoke was killed for Kylo ren’s motivation 
6. Luke saw Ben killing everyone so Luke had to kill Ben solo in his sleep
7. Rey taking the skywalker name was powerful because she is paying respect for her masters
8. Rey was using the dark side because in the throne room scene she was screaming like a rabid animal
9. Finn and rose are a great couple 
10. Luke is a old man him force projecting himself made him lose all his power
11. Finn dying in TLJ would suck.
12. Imagine getting angry over movies made for kids
13. Rey beating palpatine made sense because all the Jedi gave her their powers.
14. The bombers are a great design and very powerful and a better version of the Y-wing you just don’t see it
15. *insert movie critic youtuber. E.g. critical drinker, robot head, mauler, etc* are known for their clickbait videos and are a meme in the Star Wars community for how terrible clickbait like their videos are

These are only 15 things said defending the sequels and I could go on with a list of 348 other things. No joke I have written a list on a book with all the stupid things said defending the sequels. Anyway I’m going to debunk these rn.

1. “Rey has a great character arc, you’re just sexist.”
Well no. No one is sexist. We just hate terribly written characters.

2. “Rey is not a Mary Sue and I’ve proven countless times she’s not.” Well buddy I doubt you did. If you did then the person has no clue about Star Wars.

3. “Anakin is a Mary Sue you jUsT target Rey because she is new” No if Anakin was a Mary Sue then he would never of became Darth Vader.

4. “You must be like 12 years old to not know about Luke’s depression arc and what he is going through”
Your wrong. Luke’s character is to be optimistic as possible and never give up. Who cares if he is old because many old people like leia and Han are optimistic and they don’t even use the force.

5. “Snoke was killed for Kylos motivation” yes and no. Snoke was deemed to be powerful and dangerous creature that existed since the old republic watching over the galaxy before revealing himself, him dying for kylos motivation was done and executed poorly and didn’t show the true strength of Snoke.

6. “Luke saw Ben killing everyone so Luke had to kill Ben solo in his sleep” again. No. It’s out of Luke’s character to do so and kill someone over a vision. Luke already knew about how Jedi could have misleading visions and would not kill a defenceless Padawan over a vision”

7. “Rey taking the skywalker name was powerful because she is paying respect for her master” do you mean her master who only spent a week with her teaching her nothing and then knocking down her masters door like that parent who hates giving their kid privacy or the time where a woman you barely or never knew was a Jedi could teach you how to be a Jedi yet you couldn’t adopt a fighting style

8. “Rey was using the dark side because in the throne room scene she was screaming like a rabid animal” screaming like a animal doesn’t mean your now using the dark side. Many Jedi scream while fighting. In Star Wars the old republic the Jedi where screaming while fighting the sith but still died as Jedi and didn’t tap into the dark side.

9. “Finn and rose are a great couple” no they are not. They where thrown together so Chinese cinemas would allow the movie to run on their screens”

10. “Luke is a old man, him force projecting himself made him lose all his power” no he is force sensitive and any force sensitive being has increased eye sight, strength, knowledge, reflexes, movements, stamina etc. Luke is more then capable to stay alive even during his age. His death made no sense.

11. “Finn dying in TLJ would suck” Finn went from being a ex-stormtrooper to finding out he is force sensitive and him giving his life up to save the resistance will complete his arc and give him a legendary death.

12. “Imagine getting angry over movies made for kids” Star Wars isn’t just for the men, but the woman and the children too. But actually Star Wars really isn’t kid friendly. Clone wars has suicide, head cutting execution, dismembered bodies, clone troopers getting their body cut through doors, maul slaughtering children. In the expanded universe there are creatures that have looks that will scare kids. Take abeloth for example. She would scare kids as much as pennywise because they have a few resemblance to them

13. “Rey beating palpatine made sense because all the Jedi gave her their powers” if the Jedi where really there to give her their powers then they would appear in force ghosts and not be “every voice, you have ever heard, inside your head”  

14. “The bombers are a great design and very powerful and a better version of the Y-wing you just don’t see it” see what? A bunch of slow moving ships needing to me flown by one person, bombs handled by another person and turrets used by another person but yet they could not deliver the same fire power as the Y-wings

15. “*inset youtuber movie critic name* are known for their clickbait videos and are a meme in the Star Wars community for their terrible content” No these are a bunch of youtubers reviewing movies and giving their opinion of it and what wrongs did the movie have. They are not memes in the Star Wars community because I couldn’t find anything about it and your just a idiot.

344,The novels and visual guides are treated like fix-its for bad screenwriting,58,j04ghe,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/j04ghe/the_novels_and_visual_guides_are_treated_like/,9,1601148662.0,"The supplementary materials like visual guide books used to be just facts about different weapons, vehicles, characters seen in the movies. Sometimes, they add a little more detail and color about locations or minor characters, like telling the names of every individual at the Mos Eisley Cantina. But with the Sequels, it feels like they are used to patch up all the plotholes in the films' shoddy writing.

There's a genre of fanfiction known as the ""fix-it fic,"" where a writer takes the existing story and changes something within it that they didn't like to make it more satisfying or make more sense. It feels like Disney is making fix-it fics for their own story in some of these books.

For example, it's explained in one of the visual guides that First Order Stormtroopers have duties assigned to them besides soldiering, and that sanitation was Finn's side duty on Starkiller Base. He wasn't ""just a janitor,"" he was actually an elite soldier and considered the top of his class. In one of the novels, Hux considered Finn to be officer material and wanted to promote him. Well, you wouldn't know any of this from the way Finn is played as a joke in the movies. Finn says his job was sanitation, and when Han asks if he knows what he's doing when they go to lower the shields and rescue Rey, Finn says ""Hell, no.""

Since they removed any concept of tiers of canon, and anything officially released under the Star Wars brand is as canon as the films, these fix-its in books and guides are almost like cheating. It's all equally canon now, so it falsely gives the writers credit for creating something more coherent than they actually did. If you point out how stupid something is in the movies, someone can *""well, actually...""* you and point out some detail in a 100% canon novel, comic, or visual guide that ""explains"" the plothole.

I think once the movie is out in theatres and out on DVD, it's too late to keep revising the screenplays. What's done is done. We all saw the movies, the writers shouldn't get infinite do-overs via supplementary materials.

In 2015, after a few years of heavy anticipation, me and my family finally got to see TFA. I'm a medium-fan, loving the original triligy and appreciating a lot of stuff in the prequels. I did agree however with the broad consensus at the time, that this new trilogy would set things straight. I devoured first-hand set-reports from types like Kevin Smith, ensuring us everything was being handled with respect to what made Star Wars Star Wars in the first place. I made it an effort to expose the oldest two (boy 10 and girl 11 at the time) to all the previous movies, so they could enjoy what was to come in december 2015 to the fullest. And ofcourse...after seeing both the prequels and the originals...they freaking loooooved Star Wars!!! 

When we saw TFA we were very, very excited. The whole family loved it. Yes, there were weak points (Maz Kanata, A New Hope-rehash), but the consensus was that it fet like ""Star Wars"", and there were many places it could go. 

What got me most excited personally, was that it had a clear, strong female protagonist that my stepdaughter could allign to, that was mostly absent in the original trilogy (it being Luke's story) and the prequels (being Anakin's). The premise that my 11-year old SW-fan, that was also a girl, got to see the training of a female Jedi, a new hero for a new age got me very, very excited to say the least. And she was too! I was so happy to be a Star Wars-fan, and what an amazing time it was from dec. 2015 untill TLJ. 

Ofcourse, after TLJ and TROS, everything fell apart, even my opinion about TFA. But what hurt the most, was how Disney threw that promise away. The promise of a positive female role-model for her generation. No princess or queen, but a simple girl on her journey to become a Jedi. And I watched it happen, after the exitement for TFA and the anticipation that followed, the interest for the Saga in my family has vanished. Sometimes we rant about what happened at the kitchen table and I find it most telling that sometimes, when I use a name from the trilogy, I have to specify who I mean to my kids: ""Rey? The girl right?"" ""Finn, the stormtrooper?"" Disney set up the promise of a meaningful trilogy with TFA, and killed it with the two sequels.

Or make the hate and incompetence from KK, JJ & RJ disappear. Jake Skywalker and the nasty scene of him drinking alien milk will still exist. 

But at least with an adaptation of EU Luke, the mainstream audience could see another version of Luke that is actually well written and stay in character. It is kinda depressing when every time you search or hear about Luke Skywalker, the suicidal hobo from the sequels will pop up and in public eye, all people can think of is TLJ. For characters like Superman or Batman, they have so many versions. So even when people make fun of Batnipple George Clooney or neck snapping Man of Steel, there are still The Dark Knight Batman, Burton Batman and Christopher Reeves Superman. Technically, Luke Skywalker has 2 version: Canon and EU. But the canon failure Jake takes all the spotlight while the EU Luke stays humbly in the novels. 

Just imagine if the OG Thrawn trilogy got an animated adaptation (similar to how DC adapts their comics into independent animated movies). At least when you hear about Luke Skywalker, you can see something hopeful about Luke Skywalker being back in action. Instead of another brainless article defending Rian Johnson and explaining why TLJ Jake is the best portrayal of Luke. And I think Mark Hamill would like it too. I know Mark is deeply hurt about TLJ when his most well known role is turned into a joke for ""subversion"".

**The Force Awakens**

Not all that horrible as far as the sequels go, at least in the first half, but still severely lacking and bad. It was meant to look and feel at least sort of like Star Wars, but it was the façade, not the substance. A desert planet that's basically Tatooine with fewer buildings and more space junk, two-seated TIE fighters, slightly different stormtroopers, an obtuse reference to the trash compactor in Episode IV, and much more. Even in the midst of this movie's boatloads of manufactured hype, I could tell that Kylo was a weak character, maybe Poe, Finn, and Rey too, not to mention that Starkiller Base was an obvious piece of lazy writing, and Captain Phasma and Maz Kanata turned out to be disappointingly underused characters. I'll admit that it felt a little fun and inspiring how easily Finn and Rey beat Kylo Ren at the end, until we realized that Rey was going to be overpowered like that for the entire series.

Leia was also barely recognizable. The quick-thinking, spunky personality that made her such a great character is gone and she's reduced to nodding and saying ""yep"" to everything Rey says and sighing about how difficult Poe is. Speaking of the original Skywalkers, I was disappointed that this movie didn't have a lot more Luke, and maybe some of you are, too.

Perhaps the only fair-quality moment is Han Solo's death, but it had been rumored for months, maybe close to a year before the movie came out, so a good %60, arguably more, of that scene's potential effect was out the window.                                                                                                                               We've seen how powerful unleaked twists can be- just look at Baby Yoda, for example! The creators of *The Mandalorian* were careful not to leak his existence, even latening merchandising opportunities for it- and, for the next few months, the Internet went crazy for him. They missed a big opportunity to make the film substantially better by simply guarding their secrets better. George Lucas understood this concept. Heck, the biggest spoilers of the Original Trilogy- Luke losing a hand, Darth Vader being Luke's father, and Leia being Luke's sister don't even appear in the original script for The Empire Strikes Back. The then-secret of Luke's father didn't even come out when the scene was filmed! Specifically to keep it from seeping out, Lucasfilm had James Earl Jones instead say ""No, Obi-Wan killed your father!"" And dubbed over it later. Darth Maul's second blade was similarly concealed in the advertising for The Phantom Menace.

Finally, it irritates me that the scene in which General Hux picks up Kylo Ren and takes him to Snoke wasn't in the theater version, or that it was an after-credits scene, which you can't easily catch in theaters. You shouldn't have had to buy the DVD version to see extra content that you didn't know existed. It was a cheap move both in writing and storytelling, as it deprived a huge portion of the viewers some information that would be vital to the next movie: that Kylo Ren survives, and that Snoke is important.

We were all excited for this movie. Kylo Ren looked so cool and we were finally getting new Star Wars movies! But when you strip away all the idle hype over it existing, there was little in this movie. It was a virtual *A New Hope* remake with better visuals and some story tweaks, nearly all of them for the worse. 

In regards to the ending, putting a main character into a coma was an unbelievably clichéd idea.

As I walked out of the theater where I saw it the first time, I overheard people discussing it, a little confused, and already finding inconsistencies.

**The Last Jedi**

The snail bombers needed much better defenses to make them make sense, but they were a metaphor for the entire movie; constant, nonsensical run-around action that's not very satisfying nor leads anywhere. It distracts from the barely-existent plot, and it's bad writing in general. Instead of tactically pausing the action when it showed the Resistance fleet in space to give the movie some pacing relief, the directors had something explode every 10 minutes.

And, though this doesn't bother me as much as it does some people, Luke's state of being in this movie was too severe in ways. I'm all for tragic character arcs, but him completely shutting himself off from the Force was a step too much. The rest doesn't seem too irrational to me, (sure, he thought about killing Kylo, but he was a major threat to his small, fragile Jedi school.) But I cannot easily see him having such bad luck that he throws away the superpowerful set of abilities that he had chosen to define him and his life for the past 30 years. He had seen firsthand how powerful a force of good it can be. This was especially interesting considering how acting on emotion is against the Jedi way.           But, in all fairness, he had failed a substantial number of important people to him and, though the sequels shouldn't intrude on the originals like this, possibly many high, old hopes of bringing the Force back to the Light Side that had seemed achievable since defeating the Emperor. But instead of trying again and learning from his mistakes, by shutting himself off, he buried the Jedi's last hope.

Returning to the subject of this movie's use of action, the Praetorian guards fight scene was cool to watch the first time, but it seems very rushed and easy looking back, especially weighing that there are piles of weak, frequent action scattered around this movie, in the form of things like the First Order destroying the Resistance's medical frigate and Rose, Finn, and BB-8 dodging Kanto-Bight police. When there are action-packed moments spread all around a movie like this, it loses its effect. You stop caring about the action because you've seen so much of it, and so it gets less exciting, and lots of effect that should have been saved for the really combat-heavy scenes is lost to them.

Speaking of the ""casino planet"", I have some issues with those scenes, too, though not as much as many people. The first couple shots were actually a preciously rare bit of world-building for the sequels, but the effect drained out quickly. Apparently, everyone being a rich gambler was the whole theme of that town. Rose also apparently put unsaddling a space horse above freeing child slaves, not to mention that they somehow had Earth-design cakes in an extragalactic tea room.

Rey's ""conga line"" Force vision was bad, and a blatant, obvious attempted remake of the Cave of Evil, but at least this movie did SOMETHING with the Force. I wouldn't be surprised if Disney made the Force non-canon.

The Holdo Maneuver was interesting, but very bad for the villain presence at the end of the film. After Snoke's Super Star Destroyer is run through, (along with several others, but it's unknowable how many because of the darkness in that shot) Kylo orders to gather ""all our forces"", which turn out to be just a few gorilla walkers, Ren's shuttle, and one big gun.                                                                                                                The end of the movie had me thinking less in terms of ""oh, the Resistance did some damage to the First Order, but the First Order crippled them back!"" And a lot more ""Both sides may have decimated each other. Now neither side is very strong.""

Majorly, the Matrix reference during Luke and Kylo's 'duel' should never have been in there. Star Wars movies shouldn't follow references. If anything, they should be the movies that are referenced later!

Finally, it was as true in this movie as the last one: the scene aboard the Millennium Falcon should NOT have been DVD (or, in today's case, Disney+), exclusive! Fans deserved to know that Rey had the pieces of Luke's lightsaber and that the Jedi texts survived. Their survival made no sense all the same, but better to get it then and there than to be surprised by yet another plot hole in TROS.

**The Rise of Skywalker**

In addition to being a weak ending in general, TROS, in my opinion, has the most plot holes of any Star Wars movie, which is saying a lot, and missed a lot of opportunities TLJ tried to give it.

As most of us can attest, the writing in this movie was horribly inconsistent, a result of JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson, and some Disney-imposed fan service (and deadlines) fighting to write the script, I suppose. We see Rey struggle a little bit, but not enough to break her out of her status.

The visuals are amazing in the first eighth or so- the Blood Net, that space glacier thing, Exegol- but it was still ruined by the trademark Rian Johnson cheese and JJ Abrams nonsensical banter that was mixed in. Let's see what was written into those few scenes: a gaping hyperspace retcon, TIE fighters that can somehow track through lightspeed, that insufferable line ""Win the war!"", and a quote repeat by Palpatine that all but ruined the beloved *Revenge of The Sith* version.

And Kylo Ren's helmet gets fixed. I became disappointed as soon as I saw this in the trailer. Everyone complains about the porgs being a blunt merchandise-grab, but I'd say this is substantially worse. Yes, the red looks cool, but it outright undid one of the most meaningful moments in the entire trilogy. In addition to looking intense, that moment in which Kylo smashes his helmet on the elevator wall showed that the money-hungry makers of this trilogy might have been willing to give up a little iconography for the sake of a richer story. But they proved eager to take that back. Not only did they just reintroduce one of the most overused images of the late 2010s, but they tried to shallowly make it look cooler. Especially pointless given how the helmet was heavily shown in the advertising, but barely seen in the actual movie.                                                                                                                                                          And, according to the novelization, the remains of the *Supremacy* where combed through for the helmet's pieces. That had seemed like promising scavenging ground for one of my own trilogies, but enough about that.

The world building in TROS was okay, but the characters were awful. Exegol and the aforementioned space formations looked epic, Kijimi (the snowy mountain world), was an interesting planet, but, like Anch-To, suffered from a lack of one solid theme. That desert planet had the opposite problem: it was a near-complete clone of Tatooine, Jakuu, and Nevarro (the desert planet from *The Mandalorian*). And the culture of the festival held on it didn't go as deep as I hoped. The Death Star ruins should have caused apocalyptic damage to the moon they landed on, but at least we finally got to see the plains of Endor... sort of.

Now onto the characters. Rey got a few tiny, tiny tinges of development (when she accepted that girl's necklace at the desert festival and oiled D-0's wheel), but for the most part just remained too powerful. >!Palpatine is defeated YET AGAIN because he can't wrap his head around the thought that when someone is blasting your own Force lightning back at you and using it to kill or severely weaken you, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP BLASTING!! Rey just holds up two lightsabers to him and becomes invincible and unchallenged.  !<Kylo Ren is probably at his worst in terms of development. >!(Last word: ""Ow."")!< Nearly all the new-this-movie characters: Babu Frick, Jannah, and the D-0 droid, were either placeholder characters or merch-generators. Or both. The Knights of Ren and the Sith Troopers were both grievously underused; again, largely merch-bait, and from Rey we got a healing-a-troubled,-dangerous-creature-with-the-Force scene that we've seen at least four times in Star Wars by now. It was supposed to be impactful, but other, better writers had gotten there first.

>!Finally, I felt that there was something wrong with the final battle. Every ragtag fighter in the galaxy suddenly just decides to come and blow up some ships, and then much the same thing happens again 20 minutes later. (Though we do see the Ghost, captain Rex's starfighter, and a Mandalorian starfighter, which I find very exciting.) And the Final Order had been working on those ships for the past twenty years. I think they'd find something as obvious as a weak spot in the cannon. Sith hubris can't make you that stupid, especially considering that finding weak spots is very much on the lines of how Sith think.!<

364,I May Hate Rey...but I am thankful she exists.,65,izm5iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/izm5iz/i_may_hate_reybut_i_am_thankful_she_exists/,13,1601078501.0,"Because she provides a great source of inspiration as to what NOT to do when making a character, it especially helps me out because it helped me realize a character in a universe I made was pretty much a bad Self Insert Gary Stu OC. 

-She is this perfect entity that can do no wrong, the worst thing she does is accidentally “blow up” Chewie after playing tug of war. 

-She’s the same by the end of the trilogy as she was in the beginning.

-She has no real depth, no motivation.

-and she can do everything better than everyone else, even pilot better than the best Pilot in the Resistance apparently.

Now about this character I mentioned...around 5 years ago, I came up with the idea for this character, I was 10, and obsessed with both Batman and Deadpool, so I basically made Deadpool and Batman mixed into one, the only thing of Batman being the suit. I named him Blue Shadow, and for most of his existence I didn’t even have an idea for his real name, just the alias. He was undefeated and the best of the best in the universe, even clashing with gods. 

5 years later, he is no longer Blue Shadow, nor the best person around, he is Aaron Schultz, a German Super Soldier turned Mercenary. He is immortal, and can heal, however his healing has limits, if he takes too much damage, it would be like an overheating computer and he would die of a lethal heart attack. Most of his battles are not against his equals, only people below his skill, but he does face some people of his skill, and he doesn’t win all the time. The strongest characters in the universe now are three gods and their servants. Two of the gods are jealous, and hateful, creating demons to destroy humanity due to their belief in “false gods” and one is the god who created humanity. In the Middle Ages this god bestowed four warriors with great power to defeat these demons. They were the Chosen Sentinels. The Accuser, The Aggressor, The Ancient, and the Abyss. 

The universe spans millions of years, and Blue Shadow is no longer a major player, now he is sort of insignificant in the grand scheme of the story. 

Now why do I say I’m glad about Rey existing? Well as I previously stated, this character used to be a hardcore Gary Stu, I would constantly criticize Rey for being a Mary Sue and when someone pointed out Blue Shadow himself had the same issues, I turned a blind eye. But recently I’ve come to realize I did actually make the same mistake as those who made Rey did.

Rose's sister never works as an emotional beat for the film because the whole sequence is mechanically broken.  And because this is a formative piece that underwrites Rose ... she, too, is kind of broken by this.     This move is a perfect microcosm of why TLJ fails so badly and really highlights a weak spot in RJ's craft on this film.

I'm sure that RJ thought it would be a nice, surprising 'ah-ha' moment as the audience put together why Rose was crying .... oh that was her sister.... oh she must be deeply sad.  But doing it in that order deprives the audience of the stakes, visceral feeling, the meaning of that moment.  It also deprives the audience of their emotional investment in Rose.  

We watched nameless-Rebel-Hero #16 die.  We NEVER felt Roses' sister die.

372,a bit of rambling,9,izjco7,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/izjco7/a_bit_of_rambling/,6,1601069072.0,"Star Wars works because the stories feel like part of a larger universe. It's very similar to Lord of the Rings -- there are so many potential stories in the GFFA. Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War are great examples of stories in the LotR universe that, while not Canon, still *feel* faithful to the source material. They add to the Universe. EU fans might recognize this kind of content ""C-Canon"".

The prequels and the OT change the rules of the story. In the ""Old Republic"" Era, we accept that there are many Sith and many Jedi, and we interact with this era through the TOR games, or through the novels. In the preprequel era, we accept that the sith are unknown to the Jedi; we accept that the sith have adopted the rule of two. Therefore, any story told during this period cannot feature sith encountering Jedi. Post-prequels, we accept that the Jedi have been hunted to near extinction and that Palpatine has established a galactic empire. Jedi survivors -- Cal Kestis, Ahsoka, Kanan Jarrus -- undermine this assumption, and can lead us to ask, ""What makes Luke so special?"" I could continue, but I won't.

The sequel trilogy plays by the same rules as the Original Trilogy. And it ends without changing anything. No story can be told in the sequel trilogy that couldn't be told in the Original Trilogy. All movies, 1-6, establish or change the primary assumptions about the state of the universe. A few examples:

* 1: The rule of two; The sith appear to the jedi for the first time in millenia; midichlorians; the chosen one
* 2: The clone wars
* 3: Darth Plagueis; Jedi Purge; Galactic Empire forms
* 4: The force is a thing that exists; The empire is a thing that exists; planet destroying technology exists(and has not existed before now)
* 5: Jedi use the force for defense, never for attack; the dark side is corrupt and seductive
* 6: the empire kind of falls

Episodes 3 and 6 also contain *huge* paradigm shifts.



(Sorry if my wording is confusing, or if this is too rambly. When I say ""Rules"" it just refers to a universal assumption about the world, whether that's the state of the galaxy or just the Jedi philosophy. )

Episodes 7-9... don't do this. Oh, sure we have a planet killing weapon, but that's not new. Rey can do all kinds of things with the force, but we don't know if that's a force thing or a Rey thing. Kylo Ren and Snoke aren't Sith, but nothing distinguishes them from sith, so they might as well be. The story starts with an empire existing, and ends with it kind of falling. Nothing changes. No paradigm shift. It's nothing we haven't seen before. You can't write a television series a la Clone Wars -- it won't be significantly different from Rebels, and Rebels isn't that great.(the less said about Resistance the better)

In the Sequel Trilogy, when they had to make a planet be the home of the First Jedi Temple, they felt obligated to create a whole entirely new planet.

They then picked some very underwhelming looking real world ruins to be the basis for those ruins on that planet... They have no sense of scale and wonder, nothing that feels remotely right for what the place is supposed to be.

Instead of naming it Tython, after the homeworld of the Jedi in the expanded universe, they come up with a new name, that sounded ridiculous.

But in the Prequel trilogy? When they had to make the heart of the galactic government, the planet wide city, a concept that had long been part of the star wars franchise.

They did everything in their power to make sure it lived up to what it was supposed to be.

And when they had to name it, someone said ""we should use the name it has in the EU""

and George said... sure, why not!

Because, you can make something accurate to the previous material... or make it innacurate.

If you make it inaccurate the new viewers and unaware fans will never know.

But if you go the extra centimeter and make it accurate, then you just gave something for the long time fans to smile about.

Might I just say, extra crispy, well salted and very spicy. But as the title suggets, I came here to let off some steam, so here goes.

Today I saw a post essentially stating that the ""They fly now"" line was funny, that prequel fans all loved it and that we just deny it to hate the sequels. Under this I saw many a comment defending this stance, one thing led to another and I found my self in what you might call a debate where I made the point the line broke continuity and someone essentially came at me with the arguement this line breaks the continuity of Star Wars less than prequels as a whole break the continuity of the OT. They made points such as Bobba Fetts voice changing breaks continuity? R2's tech got downgraded? How can Leia be a Princess is she's a senator's daughter? In a sense maybe theyre not wrong and they may be right in some regards. But I attempted, making logical arguement to point out how each of these arguements dont damage the continuity. Bobba's original actor being to old to play Jango and therefore remaining Bobba Fett's voice. Leia being a Princess of Alderaan because she is a member of the Organa house. R2 literally being a war hero. What I was met with was that I was just biased and couldnt be reasoned with. I was originally willing to hear their points and debate why they werent as sound as they thought but I was simply met with this. And it was clear they werent willing to debate their stance and decided ""I will not debate you on this topic"", clearly cause they didnt have a clue what they were on about. So here I am now to make it known what I think totally breaks the continuity in the sequels and which I just hate in general.

1.) The Death Star 2.
The Death Star 2, to my knowledge at least, was pretty much blasted into tiny space chunks which orbited Endor. This was canon. It was a mission in Battlefront 2 which is canon and during this mission I do not remember seeing a moon sized chunk of space station floating by me. I saw debris, sections of hangers and command decks. No laser death beam dishes or major sections intact. Now remember, this is canon. So if it is destroyed and orbiting Endor, why didnt it crash in little chunks on Endor? I mean, it seemed to all crash on the planet it Kef Bir. Did none of it land on Endor or the Ewok homeworld? You think it would right, especially the big dish bit. How did it magically reassemble itself from the tiny bits of remaining wreckage until the whole dish section was whole? How didnt that chunk of Death Star burn up on entry to the planets atmosphere? How didnt the planets atmosphere not just give up when it did? I know it's Star Wars but still a little realism wouldve been nice when the moon sized object connected with the planet. But most importantly, can it still operate its main weopon? Can it obliterate planets? The dagger doesnt bug me nearly as much as those previous questions cause by all logic, it shouldve hit the forest moon in little chunks of space debris.

2.) Snoke
So Snoke was built up to be hunrdeds of years old and saw the rise and fall if the Republic and Empire. He was meant to be some mysterious dark robed figuire who trained Kylo Ren. Then in TLJ he was literally a burn victim in a gucci bathrobe who contributed nothing to the story and didnt live up to the hype. He just kinda sat there and we were all like ""Come on! Do something!"". Even hyped him up more by making him look like one of the original Jedi on Ach-To. Then he died and we were all confused asf cause he was the big bad and then he was dead. Then in TROS hes a clone puppeted by Palpatine or something implying either he lied or Palpatine's hundreds of years old or something. Who was he a clone of? Why did Palpatine disfiguire him when Im sure he could have bought tech of the Kaminoans or even funded them to do it in secret like he did before TCW. Could have had perfect clones of a normal person and made them a mysterious character that didnt look like Deadpool in a bad Elvis costume.

3. They Fly Now.
Now to the crux this article is all about. Surely Finn knew they could fly? He is a former Stormtrooper, hes bound to have seen one before. Not to mention Poe was a spice trader and Resistance spy guy dude. Surely in all his years he's met, seen or heard of ONE stormtrooper with a jetpack. We know the FO had them in TFA, again thanks to BF2. So why the heck is this such a surprise? Not to mention, C3PO is bound to have seen Imperial jet trooper in his day. Or been told by R2 about jet troopers. Such a stupid line for some cheap laughs.

4. Yellow lightsaber
Where the heck did she get a yellow lightsaber? The only yellow lightsabers were handed down by Jedi Temple Guards and Luke had to go find a Temple Guard's for his. And that was guarded by the Grand Inquisitor so God knows what other were guarded by. So where did she get her's? She didnt just find a crystal cause they respond to you so it wouldnt just turn yellow cause then ordinary Jedi would have had them in the Republic era and they wouldnt be as rare. Not to mention where would she find it after Jedha and Illum were destroyed and all major deposits of Kyber were likely mined for the Death Stars and Death Star ships. If its the crystal from the one Luke found I'd understand but that story came after the movie was out so I dont think it is. Like why not just make it blue, or even white like Ahsoka's. Say it was Ben's that she dredged out of that sea with the force and healed or something. Not to mention that thing looks more Sith than most Sith lightsabers, holy shit. When she pulled it put I was expecting her to ignite a red blade, not a yellow one. Made Kylo's look like a Jedi's.

5. No Real Narrator.
The Prequels and OT both have a cosistent narrator for both. R2-D2. If you take into account these stories are being told to us in the present from his perspective it works. In the case of the prequels, R2 is telling us the story of Anakin's fall to the darkside with added info obtained after the fact such as him becoming Vader. The OT is the story of Luke saving Vader and helping rid the galaxy of Sith from his perspective with info obtained after he succeeded. In TFA, R2 is literally asleep the whole 1st movie and no one is really narrating the movie. And through the rest of the movies he doesnt even really have a presence. The only two times I remember him was when he came a live to finish the map to Luke and when Leia died. So who's perspective are we seeing for the trilogy? 

These are just some of the things I hate about the sequels, not mentioning how none of it was planned as was foretold by the mighty Doomcock, as it would take me all night. I probably sound like a mad man on coke  and might be wrong in regards but I am in need of sleep and angry at sequel fans who think these shams are the best movies ever. I do genuinely think these movies could be redeemed with elbow grease and hard work by another trilogy in the right hands. Say if Rey had been possessed by Palpatine and her memory of the sequels were skewed by his presence in her mind and that is the perspective we saw. A warped twisted reality where Luke ran after being twisted by the darkside, force heal just exists and makes everyone who uses it essentially Jesus.

the death star 2 to my knowledge at least was pretty much blasted into tiny space chunks which orbited endor this was canon it was a mission in battlefront 2 which is canon and during this mission i do not remember seeing a moon sized chunk of space station floating by me i saw debris sections of hangers and command decks no laser death beam dishes or major sections intact now remember this is canon so if it is destroyed and orbiting endor why didnt it crash in little chunks on endor i mean it seemed to all crash on the planet it kef bir did none of it land on endor or the ewok homeworld you think it would right especially the big dish bit how did it magically reassemble itself from the tiny bits of remaining wreckage until the whole dish section was whole how didnt that chunk of death star burn up on entry to the planets atmosphere how didnt the planets atmosphere not just give up when it did i know its star wars but still a little realism wouldve been nice when the moon sized object connected with the planet but most importantly can it still operate its main weopon can it obliterate planets the dagger doesnt bug me nearly as much as those previous questions cause by all logic it shouldve hit the forest moon in little chunks of space debris snoke
so snoke was built up to be hunrdeds of years old and saw the rise and fall if the republic and empire he was meant to be some mysterious dark robed figuire who trained kylo ren then in tlj he was literally a burn victim in a gucci bathrobe who contributed nothing to the story and didnt live up to the hype he just kinda sat there and we were all like come on do something even hyped him up more by making him look like one of the original jedi on achto then he died and we were all confused asf cause he was the big bad and then he was dead then in tros hes a clone puppeted by palpatine or something implying either he lied or palpatines hundreds of years old or something who was he a clone of why did palpatine disfiguire him when im sure he could have bought tech of the kaminoans or even funded them to do it in secret like he did before tcw could have had perfect clones of a normal person and made them a mysterious character that didnt look like deadpool in a bad elvis costume they fly now
now to the crux this article is all about surely finn knew they could fly he is a former stormtrooper hes bound to have seen one before not to mention poe was a spice trader and resistance spy guy dude surely in all his years hes met seen or heard of one stormtrooper with a jetpack we know the fo had them in tfa again thanks to bf2 so why the heck is this such a surprise not to mention c3po is bound to have seen imperial jet trooper in his day or been told by r2 about jet troopers such a stupid line for some cheap laughs yellow lightsaber
where the heck did she get a yellow lightsaber the only yellow lightsabers were handed down by jedi temple guards and luke had to go find a temple guards for his and that was guarded by the grand inquisitor so god knows what other were guarded by so where did she get hers she didnt just find a crystal cause they respond to you so it wouldnt just turn yellow cause then ordinary jedi would have had them in the republic era and they wouldnt be as rare not to mention where would she find it after jedha and illum were destroyed and all major deposits of kyber were likely mined for the death stars and death star ships if its the crystal from the one luke found id understand but that story came after the movie was out so i dont think it is like why not just make it blue or even white like ahsokas say it was bens that she dredged out of that sea with the force and healed or something not to mention that thing looks more sith than most sith lightsabers holy shit when she pulled it put i was expecting her to ignite a red blade not a yellow one made kylos look like a jedis no real narrator
the prequels and ot both have a cosistent narrator for both r2d2 if you take into account these stories are being told to us in the present from his perspective it works in the case of the prequels r2 is telling us the story of anakins fall to the darkside with added info obtained after the fact such as him becoming vader the ot is the story of luke saving vader and helping rid the galaxy of sith from his perspective with info obtained after he succeeded in tfa r2 is literally asleep the whole 1st movie and no one is really narrating the movie and through the rest of the movies he doesnt even really have a presence the only two times i remember him was when he came a live to finish the map to luke and when leia died so whos perspective are we seeing for the trilogy  are just some of the things i hate about the sequels not mentioning how none of it was planned as was foretold by the mighty doomcock as it would take me all night i probably sound like a mad man on coke  and might be wrong in regards but i am in need of sleep and angry at sequel fans who think these shams are the best movies ever i do genuinely think these movies could be redeemed with elbow grease and hard work by another trilogy in the right hands say if rey had been possessed by palpatine and her memory of the sequels were skewed by his presence in her mind and that is the perspective we saw a warped twisted reality where luke ran after being twisted by the darkside force heal just exists and makes everyone who uses it essentially jesus they could have ben have survived or something and have him try to redeem himself for a trilogy but anyway ive vented enough and must go and dream of a day where we once again get decent star wars",1,7612,1456,1,0.093,0.825,0.083,-0.9835

This is one of my least favorite scenes because it's a prime example of how Rian Johnson uses 'moments' with visuals and pretentious dialogue to pique emotion when the moments are not earned and are in contravention of established character or events on screen.

So, let's start with just the whole clown Yoda thing being nostalgia bait. Yoda never acted the clown once he revealed himself in ESB. It was a one-time ruse to test Luke. It's not his personality. The 'real' Yoda is more like the guy who counseled Anakin or the one who comforted Chewbacca. Very somber.

But more seriously than that is the way the scene pretends to connect parallels that don't exist.

""We are what they grow beyond,"" sets up the idea that Yoda is to Luke what Luke is to Rey and that Rey has reached a level of no longer needing Luke's teaching and Luke must let go.

Yet that ignores the fact that Luke has not grown beyond Yoda. So Rey no longer needs Luke's advice since she has grown to the point of trusting in the Force to make her own choices, but Luke still needs Yoda to hold his hand. When does Luke grow beyond? It's self-contradictory.

It also reveals how the Disney SW movies ape the iconic relations of the OT without putting in the effort to establish them in a realistic way.

Yoda was a willing teacher to Luke who cooperated with his student in his goal of becoming a Jedi, i.e. he is a mentor. To say a student grows beyond a teacher makes sense in this case because the teacher helps a student along a path and then falls behind.

Luke was an antagonist to Rey. He actively stymied her goals. The parallel with young Luke and Yoda does not exist. 'Growing beyond' doesn't make sense in an adversarial relationship since Luke was never trying to set her on any road and everything Rey accomplished in TLJ came in spite of Luke.

But Johnson knows he's playing with icons where old Luke is in the ESB Yoda role and Rey is in the ESB Luke role, so he just lets the imagery carry the emotion despite the connection not actually being made in the movie.

And if you're not paying attention, you DO miss the fact that Luke is not Rey's teacher and that Yoda's whole premise of Rey growing beyond her teacher is not applicable because the movie set up cosmetic resemblances to the Dagobah sequences.

A poor scene. Badly written. But which wins over a lot of the audience with Pavlovian nostalgia since they focus only on the unsubtle themesplaining slogan. In many ways it's no different from people cheering when they hear 'USA!' chants or 'Make America Great Again.' There is no analysis of what those words mean in context.

394,My take on the Anakin/Chosen One controversy . . .,0,iyzpp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/iyzpp8/my_take_on_the_anakinchosen_one_controversy/,3,1600991304.0,"I just realized something: RoS did not ruin Vader’s arc. Many people say that Vader “brought balance to the force” by killing Palpatine in RotJ, but then RoS ruined that prophecy (or whatever word you want to use) by saying that Palpatine survived. I’m not here to contest whether bringing back Palpatine was dumb or not (it was dumb), but I don’t think bringing him back ruined Vader’s legacy. 

Reason A: Vader’s sacrifice of “killing” or getting rid of Palpatine shows how he has changed and is willing to save his son even if it means the end of his life. Palpatine surviving that doesn’t change the “meaning” behind the sacrifice (but before you attack me, it still is dumb that Palpatine survived). 

Reason B: people say that it ruins the chosen one prophecy, but even when it was only two trilogies, I don’t think that Vader fulfilled the chosen one prophecy in RotJ, rather he fulfilled it in RotS. “Killing” Palpatine in RotJ wasn’t to fulfill the prophecy but rather it was to show his change to the light and his love for his son. Even when it was only the original trilogy, Vader made the force unbalanced by killing Palpatine because then the only Jedi was Luke (and maybe Leia if you want to argue) and there were no Sith. Then, the force was unbalanced in the favor of the light. Rather, Anakin fulfilled the prophecy in RotS (and a bit afterward) when he destroyed the Jedi Order. At that point in RotS, there were only two Jedi, Yoda and Obi-Wan, and only two Sith, Vader and Palpatine (you can argue that Ahsoka, Maul, Inquisitors, and other Jedi who survived Order 66 made the force unbalanced, but Ahsoka and Maul were both neither Sith nor Jedi and most of the other Jedi who survived turned themselves away from the force (think Kanan right after Order 66) and the Inquisitors (who came later) were not force users). 

Point is, Palpatine surviving is still dumb, but I do not believe that it undoes the Chosen One prophecy and Anakin bringing balance to the force because Anakin brought balance to the force in RotS rather than RotJ where he did not bring balance (in either the original idea where Palpatine died or the newer one where Palpatine survived)",saltierthancrait,my take on the anakinchosen one controversy    i just realized something ros did not ruin vader’s arc many people say that vader “brought balance to the force” by killing palpatine in rotj but then ros ruined that prophecy or whatever word you want to use by saying that palpatine survived i’m not here to contest whether bringing back palpatine was dumb or not it was dumb but i don’t think bringing him back ruined vader’s legacy  a vader’s sacrifice of “killing” or getting rid of palpatine shows how he has changed and is willing to save his son even if it means the end of his life palpatine surviving that doesn’t change the “meaning” behind the sacrifice but before you attack me it still is dumb that palpatine survived  b people say that it ruins the chosen one prophecy but even when it was only two trilogies i don’t think that vader fulfilled the chosen one prophecy in rotj rather he fulfilled it in rots “killing” palpatine in rotj wasn’t to fulfill the prophecy but rather it was to show his change to the light and his love for his son even when it was only the original trilogy vader made the force unbalanced by killing palpatine because then the only jedi was luke and maybe leia if you want to argue and there were no sith then the force was unbalanced in the favor of the light rather anakin fulfilled the prophecy in rots and a bit afterward when he destroyed the jedi order at that point in rots there were only two jedi yoda and obiwan and only two sith vader and palpatine you can argue that ahsoka maul inquisitors and other jedi who survived order 66 made the force unbalanced but ahsoka and maul were both neither sith nor jedi and most of the other jedi who survived turned themselves away from the force think kanan right after order 66 and the inquisitors who came later were not force users  is palpatine surviving is still dumb but i do not believe that it undoes the chosen one prophecy and anakin bringing balance to the force because anakin brought balance to the force in rots rather than rotj where he did not bring balance in either the original idea where palpatine died or the newer one where palpatine survived,1,2231,397,1,0.114,0.762,0.124,0.211

I might just be an idiot, but Thrawn seemed like a repudiation of the trope that all imperial high command officers were idiots.  
Anyone who followed most depictions of the character likely came to the same conclusion as me: That he is a consequentialist thinker, who is willing to put his inmidiate interests on hold, and adjust his behaviour if it meant good long term results. A man, who despite doing all in his power to win, would still respect his opponents, even if he gave them no reprieve. Someone, who usually avoided capital punishment in his ranks, unles they had proven themselves an active detriment to the imperial war effort, and someone who would rather reasign someone to better suit their talents than rigidly keep or dismiss them completely.

So I ask, what happened here?  
I would call Rebels Thrawn smoke and mirrors, but the saying goes, that wherever there's smoke, there's also fire, and this boy has been nothing but hot air.  
They of course got some of his traits right, like is affinity to understand his enemies through other aspects of their culture, or his personality that demanded authority by remaining calm under pressure, but there is just soo much wrong there, especially in the military performance department, that I can't even itemise it here without suffering an aneurysm.

So my final question: Why did Timothy Zahn aprove of this adaptation? Did he not observe all of it? Was it Disney strongarming? Am I just an idiot for expecting better?

they of course got some of his traits right like is affinity to understand his enemies through other aspects of their culture or his personality that demanded authority by remaining calm under pressure but there is just soo much wrong there especially in the military performance department that i cant even itemise it here without suffering an aneurysm my final question why did timothy zahn aprove of this adaptation did he not observe all of it was it disney strongarming am i just an idiot for expecting better and fine bit of irony is that disney thrawn got shoehorned into being the designer behind the recanonised tie defender while legends thrawn designed the literal counter to that ship",1,1897,320,1,0.155,0.701,0.144,-0.6518

399,What if the Yuuzhan Vong War happens in between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens?,4,iyrx8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/iyrx8x/what_if_the_yuuzhan_vong_war_happens_in_between/,10,1600957344.0,"I just had this extended thought and texted it all to my friends, so I’m copying it here. This might be a bit long...

What if the Yuuzhan Vong War had happened in between episodes 6 and 7? That’s what the OT heroes were up to, they all fought in this war and the galaxy is recovering from it. As in, the New Republic’s difficulty in defeating the Vong led to growing support of strong fascist leadership, and so the First Order was able to ride this wave towards becoming a significant power in the galaxy. AND, the New Republic has a reduced military capacity because it lost many ships in the war and its economic recovery strategies involved recycling military armaments into more beneficial projects! And so, when the First Order starts getting violent, they have to reverse all this legislation to actually start having a standing army again!


I also really like this idea that the Star Wars galaxy is just constantly at war. Like, it makes sense, it’s in the title. But, the story starts with Episode 1, where it’s peacetime but then a small, planetary conflict emerges (as in, the ‘war’ in Episode 1 is constrained to one planet) - side note, how well fleshed out of a planet is Naboo? Like, we have a vast jungle section filled with creatures, vast plains, a wealthy human centered capital city of Theed, and an entire other underwater civilization with its own power system surrounded by an expansive underwater ecosystem teeming with strange alien life forms and then Episode 2 begins the clone wars and by episode 3 it’s a galactic conflict, with the war going from the core to the outer rim. 

Then, in the Original Trilogy, the Empire has taken over but the rebellion slowly grows from small pockets to a larger organized group that topples the rebellion. Then, the New Republic is finally established after 20 years of imperial rule and then an armada from a WHOLE NOTHER GALAXY arrives, making this now an intergalactic war! Star Wars goes INTER GAAALACTIC! And then the Vong are defeated after a devastating war that wreaked havoc on the galaxy. Now, 30 years after the toppling of the empire and 10 years after the final defeat of the Yuuzhan Vong, the story picks up in a Star Wars galaxy that isn’t the one you know, but one that’s gonna rock your midichlorians off. 

But yeah so Yuuzhan Vong war would help fill in a lot of the gaps. I had this thought earlier, but what if Snoke was an ally to Luke Han and Leia during the war? And he was secretly bringing Ben Solo, also a prominent figure in the war, to the dark side. Ben Solo would’ve been in his late teens and 20s, which is the perfect time for someone to get caught up in a brutal deadly war and  fall to the dark side via the horrors of war. And then it explains why the galaxy would potentially want a return to dictatorship. 

I’ve also always thought this was super obvious; have Mara Jade be in the story, married to Luke and everything, but she was killed by Ben Solo! It’s a perfectly reasonable excuse for her not being in the story, and gives a more personal reason for Luke to be so ashamed of his failure. I say do the Yuuzhan Vong war through video games, comic books, and novels. A cartoon would be cool but honestly I think video games would be better. Like, 3 video games that are like Jedi Fallen Order, where you can play as Luke, Mara Jade, Ben Solo, or Anakin Solo, who would die at the end. 

And so that makes it a longer lasting conflict, like I’d say the Vong war could last 5-8 years or something, maybe closer to 5 but it would be a long and galaxy wide conflict. The galaxy would be united and when the war ends there’d be a sense of peace and prosperity. And the galaxy would thrive, for a time, with new technological integrations and a raised quality of life in many star systems. 

But this peace would not last, as, while the New Republic’s outreach programs have proved largely successful to the systems they have helped, many outer rim populations felt neglected and forgotten, and some even mistreated by New a Republic energy programs seeking to harvest their natural resources to aid production. 

And so the remains of the empire, who had once led an attempt to return the empire to its former glory (about five years after the Battle of Endor), collapsed due to infighting and faded into obscurity, they took their fighting deep into the Unknown Regions

Where warlords reigned and oppressed people perished

Until, over a period of decades, one man cobbled together the different factions of the empire that still remained. Gideon’s legion, Thrawn’s Acolytes, The Tarkin Brotherhood, all of these small groups, at war with each other for years, were gathered under one masthead: The First Order. Under the command of Snoke, a hero of the Vong War, and dark side acolyte who had studied the ancient ways of the force for many years, the First Order waited. Waited for the New Republic to falter, for Snoke to grasp the reigns of any remaining imperial legion, and for the supreme leader to begin procuring an armada, and an army, to supplement his new would-be empire. 

And then, through his agent Ben Solo - having given himself to the dark side - destroys the new Jedi academy, extinguishing a light in the galaxy that had only just begun to burn brightly. 

The New Jedi Order, spearheaded by Grand Master Luke Skywalker, were an integral part of the New Republic’s war effort, leading the charge against the Vong despite their resilience to the Jedi’s force abilities. 

Many Jedi became celebrated and famous in the war, and afterwards some of the most prominent left the Jedi path to walk a life of fame and fortune or of galactic governance. Luke remained, of course, as one of the few masters of the Jedi. With his apprentice Ben Solo at his side, the Jedi were still a powerful, but small, force in the galaxy, with Jedi Knights scattered across the galaxy acting as emissaries and deescalating various conflicts throughout the galaxy.

And so, when Ben Solo leads a massacre at the Jedi Temple, he kills some important figures, but not all, with mostly younger apprentices loving at the temple full time. And so his years up until the start of The Force Awakens has been spent hunting the Jedi who are scattered across the galaxy, acting as his grandfather once did, a fearless Jedi hunter.

TL;DR The Yuuzhan Vong war fills in a lot of gaps between the two movies, and provides for a lot of storytelling potential and a world that is forced to be different from the original trilogy. The galaxy has moved on and there’s a whole war we didn’t see, and now we pick up in the decade after the war ends.",saltierthancrait,"what if the yuuzhan vong war happens in between return of the jedi and the force awakens i just had this extended thought and texted it all to my friends so i’m copying it here this might be a bit long if the yuuzhan vong war had happened in between episodes 6 and 7 that’s what the ot heroes were up to they all fought in this war and the galaxy is recovering from it as in the new republic’s difficulty in defeating the vong led to growing support of strong fascist leadership and so the first order was able to ride this wave towards becoming a significant power in the galaxy and the new republic has a reduced military capacity because it lost many ships in the war and its economic recovery strategies involved recycling military armaments into more beneficial projects and so when the first order starts getting violent they have to reverse all this legislation to actually start having a standing army again

Mind you, this is based on their new canon comic series ""The Rise of Kylo Ren"" which was published last year.

Compare this with the stories we have from established EU authors such as Timothy Zahn and James Luceno, and the difference is appalling. When Disney took over, I was hoping that there would have been better control over the various media that was published under the Star Wars name so that they could avoid various loopholes and contradictory stories (what happened with Karen Traviss' Republic Commando series is a good example of the latter). 

Completely throwing out the entire EU after the takeover was an incredibly short-sighted move. Disney and LucasFilm could have cherry picked whatever stories that they wanted to keep as canon and still have a lot of room to mess around to create more stories for the Galaxy. 

I'm avoiding anything related to the Sequel Trilogy as far as possible because of the terrible and nonsensical stories that have published. The rubbish quality of the films certainly didn't help. Thankfully, Timothy Zahn's new Thrawn novels and the new Vader comic series have a certain level of quality about them; because at the rate I'm going through the old EU novels, I'm going to run out of Star Wars media to read very quickly.

What do we think the odds are of this thing succeeding? This doesn't seem to be Filoni's team. I guess in standard Lucasfilm practice (""plan? what's a plan?""), Publishing are maybe doing their own separate thing from TV and film. Do they have any chance whatever?

What do we think about Soule and Siglain? Soule basically has to be Timothy Zahn crossed with Joss Whedon at this point: he's got the role of setting up the pieces. If he fails, the High Republic (and all future Star Wars probably) is dead on arrival. No pressure. But who even is Siglain? How long has he been in this role?

Apart from Soule and Siglain, the core writers are: Justina Ireland, Daniel José Older, Cavan Scott, Claudia Gray. Gray we know. (Lost Stars, Bloodline, Leia). Chuck ""Aftermath"" Wendig, very visibly not there, thankfully. I haven't read Gray but I *think* the general impression is that she isn't a bad writer if she weren't shackled to the DT disaster. What about the others?

In my opinion, the only way High Republic can succeed is if they do something to the universe that detaches it from the now unviable Star Wars timeline. It is possible that something called a 'Great Disaster' *might* be big enough in scope to do this. If they do, they *might* have a chance.

(It also seems unlikely to have much suspense if it's set in the past but there's a galaxy-spanning threat. So from a writing perspective, making it its own timeline would be a logical thing to do, even if their mission *wasn't* to save Star Wars from the four-to-six billion dollar bomb it currently is.)

In terms of Lucasfilm Kremlinology (only 80s kids will understand that reference): how many warring factions do we now think there are within Lucasfilm, and which one do we think is on top? Are we looking at Filoni vs Siglain as the two contenders for ""showrunner of Star Wars"" right now?

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-light-of-the-jedi-kicks-off-star-wars-the-high-republic

>The High Republic begins with Star Wars: Light of the Jedi, a prose novel published by Del Rey and written by someone familiar to fans of the franchise: Charles Soule, who’s been writing Star Wars comic books for Marvel for the past five years, including his current tenure on the core series.

>It’s the first Star Wars novel from Soule, and one that has to introduce readers to a number of new worlds, literally and figuratively — which, of course, makes it an ideal opportunity for Soule to get very ambitious indeed. “It’s a disaster movie; it’s a mystery; it’s a race-against-time-team-on-a-mission story,” he told The Hollywood Reporter.

>Light of the Jedi will finally open the doors to the Star Wars: The High Republic for Star Wars fans — it’s the first huge piece of the actual story my High Republic collaborators and I have been building for years. A lot of the teases and such that have been released so far are focused on the character designs or the state of the galaxy … but I can tell you that we’ve all spent most of our time on the story itself. Light of the Jedi, Into the Dark, Test of Courage, the Marvel and IDW comic series …  they’re really what The High Republic is. 

>And so, having the responsibility of introducing that story with the first novel out of the gate … I’m thrilled that I got the opportunity, and I took it very seriously. The scope of Light of the Jedi, and the fact that so much is sort of keyed to it … I’m obviously aware of all of that, and knew it when I took the job. Is it a little intimidating? Sure. But I really think it inspired me to work at my highest level. I’m very proud of the book, and I can’t wait to see what people think.

> I’d been working on Star Wars comics for Marvel for several years when I was approached by Michael Siglain [creative director at Lucasfilm Publishing] to be part of what was known at the time as “Project Luminous.” 

>At any rate, Mike was building a group of five writers to help put together what became The High Republic, and I was just lucky to get the call. The writers are all pretty different — I’m not Justina Ireland, and Daniel José Older isn’t Cavan Scott or Claudia Gray — but Mike was really smart in bringing together a group that could use our individual points of view on Star Wars to build out a really fleshed-out new era in The High Republic.

>The “Great Disaster” that opens Light of the Jedi is one of those. I thought it would work because of the things you cited — the idea of having a lot of people involved in one event that operates on a galactic scale seemed very appealing. I could introduce a large cast in a very organic way, in various locations from the highest levels of galactic government to the “Jedi on the street” as they respond to the disaster.

>We haven’t talked about the Nihil — the main villains of the piece, who are a group of anarchic marauders with some unique abilities that make them very powerful and very dangerous in this era. I wanted to paint them as truly frightening — the villains we’re used to seeing in Star Wars at least have some sort of loyalty to an ideology or code … the Nihil do not, except perhaps to do whatever they want whenever they want, and to destroy anyone or anything that opposes that goal. They have a deep and detailed history that will be explored throughout the initiative — the Nihil and what they get up to is one of the coolest parts of the whole thing.

>Star Wars: Light of the Jedi will be released Jan. 5, 2021.

Edit: I guess High Republic era has been pushed forward to only 200 years before the Prequels. Also, development began in September 2018. Those are two positive signs if my wildest fan-theory hope is true (ie, that HR is a skunkworks project formed by the adults in the room as a direct response to realising that the film people were out of control and that TLJ had made the films now completely unsalvageable, and with the intention to just cut all of the PT-OT-DT era out of history and start fresh with an actual plan).

I don't know that that *is* the intention. But I want to hope. I want very much to be able to hope.

Hope is like the sun, it can suddenly get sucked into a giant laser and blow up the galaxy.

Edit 2: The first chapter of LotJ is up (it went up three months ago, apparently)

https://www.ign.com/articles/read-the-first-chapter-of-star-wars-the-high-republic-light-of-the-jedi-by-charles-soule

It's a good first chapter. Terse, technothriller style, military precision. Recognisable stock-standard scifi background, which is all Star Wars needs to be. Feels like Zahn. There's something weird and evil in hyperspace itself, reminiscent of Warhammer 40K, so there's the potential for the reality-warping shenanigans they need. If the Nihil come from hyperspace then they can be the random factor that upsets the balance.

 high republic begins with star wars light of the jedi a prose novel published by del rey and written by someone familiar to fans of the franchise charles soule who’s been writing star wars comic books for marvel for the past five years including his current tenure on the core series the first star wars novel from soule and one that has to introduce readers to a number of new worlds literally and figuratively — which of course makes it an ideal opportunity for soule to get very ambitious indeed “it’s a disaster movie it’s a mystery it’s a raceagainsttimeteamonamission story” he told the hollywood reporter of the jedi will finally open the doors to the star wars the high republic for star wars fans — it’s the first huge piece of the actual story my high republic collaborators and i have been building for years a lot of the teases and such that have been released so far are focused on the character designs or the state of the galaxy … but i can tell you that we’ve all spent most of our time on the story itself light of the jedi into the dark test of courage the marvel and idw comic series …  they’re really what the high republic is  so having the responsibility of introducing that story with the first novel out of the gate … i’m thrilled that i got the opportunity and i took it very seriously the scope of light of the jedi and the fact that so much is sort of keyed to it … i’m obviously aware of all of that and knew it when i took the job is it a little intimidating sure but i really think it inspired me to work at my highest level i’m very proud of the book and i can’t wait to see what people think i’d been working on star wars comics for marvel for several years when i was approached by michael siglain creative director at lucasfilm publishing to be part of what was known at the time as “project luminous”  any rate mike was building a group of five writers to help put together what became the high republic and i was just lucky to get the call the writers are all pretty different — i’m not justina ireland and daniel josé older isn’t cavan scott or claudia gray — but mike was really smart in bringing together a group that could use our individual points of view on star wars to build out a really fleshedout new era in the high republic “great disaster” that opens light of the jedi is one of those i thought it would work because of the things you cited — the idea of having a lot of people involved in one event that operates on a galactic scale seemed very appealing i could introduce a large cast in a very organic way in various locations from the highest levels of galactic government to the “jedi on the street” as they respond to the disaster haven’t talked about the nihil — the main villains of the piece who are a group of anarchic marauders with some unique abilities that make them very powerful and very dangerous in this era i wanted to paint them as truly frightening — the villains we’re used to seeing in star wars at least have some sort of loyalty to an ideology or code … the nihil do not except perhaps to do whatever they want whenever they want and to destroy anyone or anything that opposes that goal they have a deep and detailed history that will be explored throughout the initiative — the nihil and what they get up to is one of the coolest parts of the whole thing wars light of the jedi will be released jan 5 2021 i guess high republic era has been pushed forward to only 200 years before the prequels also development began in september 2018 those are two positive signs if my wildest fantheory hope is true ie that hr is a skunkworks project formed by the adults in the room as a direct response to realising that the film people were out of control and that tlj had made the films now completely unsalvageable and with the intention to just cut all of the ptotdt era out of history and start fresh with an actual plan dont know that that is the intention but i want to hope i want very much to be able to hope is like the sun it can suddenly get sucked into a giant laser and blow up the galaxy

That's not really a problem, if it was made up of those Imperial Star Destroyers that vanished/were claimed to be destroyed. 

But they're not. They're entirely new ship designs made decades later, in the middle of nowhere, that just happen to look like the original Imperial 1 Star Destroyer but slightly larger. The Evolution of the design of the Star Destroyer  goes Imperial 1 - Imperial 2 - Resurgence - Imperial 1 but slightly larger. 

The entire fleet is composed of...*just* that one ship type. No support ships, no escorts, none of the First Order ship designs, Just the slightly larger Imperial 1 and nothing else at all, as if that's all that's needed. Even with the First Order we see at least 3 different ship types, and more are shown elsewhere, but the Final Order? Doesn't even attempt to be a proper fleet with the considerations that come with it. 

Ontop of that, giving every one a Death Star Cannon? How could anyone write that in a serious way? Who would think that's a the best thing to do? If they wanted a ship with a Death Star canon, that can be done in a cool way - Just think of  the Eclipse class from legends. A huge super star destroyer with a mini Death Star canon. Giving every ship there just cheapens it and made it laughable. 

The way the movie has them is lazy, uninspired, extremely poor world building and writing overall, and just seems like it had no thought put into it in the slightest. The whole concept of them is perhaps the most uninspired aspect of the trilogy. 

It's just so utterly absurd that it's baffling how anyone could think that sort of writing was a good idea, let alone in the specific way it was done in the movie, and even more so as part of the Star Wars saga.

If JJ came up with them (I sort of doubt it was him though?), then that emphasizes to me that he really, really wasn't suitable to handle Star Wars.

I despise the Disney trilogy and I like the original 6 movies and the EU. I am not fond of his portrayal in TROS (or how he was killed) and I would have preferred if he had not been in the new movies so that they could do something new. That being said, I do not think bringing Palpatine back to life is a bad idea in itself even in the context of the prophecy. Why?

It does not violate the prophecy or undo Vaders sacrifice. Supposing Vader kills Sidious but 6 years later he resurfaces, the fact remains that:

* In universe the prophecy seems simple and straightforward but was still pretty vague (ex: it never told us the Chosen One would help kill off the Jedi Order) One interpretation was that ""destroy the Sith"" specifically meant ending Darth Banes Rule of Two Sith which Anakin/Vader did by killing Palps and by dying himself.
* To add on to the previous point, Palpatine stopped caring about the Rule of Two and wanted to rule the galaxy forever with various minions under him instead of someone taking his place. And he failed to convert Luke anyway.
* Vader still managed to save Luke and is redeemed.
* Helped give rise to a fledgling New Republic.
* Luke is able to start the New Jedi Order, which helps bolster New Republic forces and plays an important role in the Vong war, among other crises.

And it is completely in-character. That man is far too power obsessed to give up on life so easily, especially when he has the knowledge, power, and skill to make resurrection a viable option.

That being said I will say that I like Dark Empire more for its potential than for the execution and I thought Luke serving Palpatine was anathema to what we saw at the end ROTJ. And I get that from a thematic standpoint bringing back the dead villain can be a bit stale. Also, I think Anakins force ghost should have played a role in putting the (this time) final nail in the coffin so to speak.

However when I see this (the stuff below) I just can't help but think of how much potential is there waiting to be unearthed. For example: using his return to inform Luke's views on the nature of the dark side and the force, seeing how much he has grown as a lightsaber duelist, realizing there are more Order 66 survivors out there, etc. I just felt compelled to make this post because it kind of irks me how whenever TROS or Palpatine's return is brought up, DE is almost always billed as among the ""worst"" things in the EU which it isn't. But what do you guys think? Did I change your mind or not? Any alternative ideas for a reappearance from the most powerful Sith Lord the galaxy has ever seen?

https://reddit.com/link/ixvmjy/video/c9oq16dgaro51/player",saltierthancrait,"bringing palpatine back was not a bad idea before you send me to the netherworld just hear me out i despise the disney trilogy and i like the original 6 movies and the eu i am not fond of his portrayal in tros or how he was killed and i would have preferred if he had not been in the new movies so that they could do something new that being said i do not think bringing palpatine back to life is a bad idea in itself even in the context of the prophecy why does not violate the prophecy or undo vaders sacrifice supposing vader kills sidious but 6 years later he resurfaces the fact remains that in universe the prophecy seems simple and straightforward but was still pretty vague ex it never told us the chosen one would help kill off the jedi order one interpretation was that destroy the sith specifically meant ending darth banes rule of two sith which anakinvader did by killing palps and by dying himself
 to add on to the previous point palpatine stopped caring about the rule of two and wanted to rule the galaxy forever with various minions under him instead of someone taking his place and he failed to convert luke anyway
 vader still managed to save luke and is redeemed
 helped give rise to a fledgling new republic
 luke is able to start the new jedi order which helps bolster new republic forces and plays an important role in the vong war among other crises it is completely incharacter that man is far too power obsessed to give up on life so easily especially when he has the knowledge power and skill to make resurrection a viable option being said i will say that i like dark empire more for its potential than for the execution and i thought luke serving palpatine was anathema to what we saw at the end rotj and i get that from a thematic standpoint bringing back the dead villain can be a bit stale also i think anakins force ghost should have played a role in putting the this time final nail in the coffin so to speak when i see this the stuff below i just cant help but think of how much potential is there waiting to be unearthed for example using his return to inform lukes views on the nature of the dark side and the force seeing how much he has grown as a lightsaber duelist realizing there are more order 66 survivors out there etc i just felt compelled to make this post because it kind of irks me how whenever tros or palpatines return is brought up de is almost always billed as among the worst things in the eu which it isnt but what do you guys think did i change your mind or not any alternative ideas for a reappearance from the most powerful sith lord the galaxy has ever seen

425,What if the ST took place after the OT heroes had died?,34,ixvm34,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ixvm34/what_if_the_st_took_place_after_the_ot_heroes_had/,10,1600835389.0,"What if the ST took place 60-70 years after OT instead of 20-30 years? It’s so much more believable that new villains have arisen over the course of a couple generations, instead of making Luke, Leia, and Han look like failures for all their work being destroyed in their own lifetimes. 

It would also make more sense for Leia and Han’s grandson, or even great-grandson, to hero-worship Darth Vader rather than their son. In theory, Kylo should have heard the full story of Vader from Luke or his parents, and it never really made sense why he didn’t. But if the new Sith apprentice had a generational gap, it would be more plausible that he didn’t know everything, or if the details got fudged over time. 

Of course, many people wanted our beloved favorite actors from the OT to be involved in the new movies. But Luke (and Leia) could have easily appeared as Force ghosts, and they could have shown Han and Lando in flashbacks potentially. That way Disney can still get the fan service, but it would actually make sense why the original heroes weren’t just saving the galaxy like we know they can. And it would be more satisfying than the excuses we got (Luke is bummed out and Han just likes smuggling better).

Full disclosure, I had this thought after jumping on the Avatar: The Last Airbender bandwagon and watching The Legend of Korra. I found it to be a much more satisfying sequel than anything in the ST. I think part of the reason is because of the significant time gap. They firmly put the original heroes in the past, so we can focus on the new protagonists without wondering why the beloved originals were being sidelined. We even got cameo appearances from Toph and Katara, but in a way that honored their original legacy and didn’t outshine the new characters.

&#x200B;

West Coast: Galaxy's Edge

Setting: Tatooine, 2 ABY. The Galactic Civil War is slowly heating up, with the morale boost of Yavin resulting in the Rebellion gaining ground against the Empire. However, they won't let their already-loose grip on the Outer Rim slip. The architecture is very Tatooinian, with sandy roads, blocky buildings, and the occasional brown cliffs here and there.

&#x200B;

Smuggler's Run: The ride is still set in the Millennium Falcon, but it has a setting update to the OT. Han and Chewie are the hosts instead of Hondo, and you're stealing goods from an Imperial facility.

&#x200B;

Star Wars: Rebel Stand: Mostly the same as Rise of the Resistance, but with the characters obviously swapped to OT-era characters and the setting being updated to the OT era.

Star Wars: TIE Fighter: For the Imperial side, a flight sim will be modeled after the TIE Fighter, with one guest per cockpit. There are 16 TIE Fighters in the squadron (thus 16 guests per session), going on a mission to stop a Rebel fleet from escaping Tatooine. Guests aim and fire the fighters' guns at various fighters and critical points to score points, with a hall of fame being displayed at the end. By the way, the bad guys win and destroy the fleet, with a personal congratulations from the admiral.

Kr@yt Canyon Rollercoaster: A rollercoaster rolling through the Tatooine canyons and caves. Audio-animatronic Jawas and Tusken Raiders can be seen, including a Kr@yt dragon with glowing eyes nestled in one of the caves.

Mos Eisley Cantina: This is the legendary restaurant you've been waiting for. Aside from regular service, it has a drink bar and life-sized alien statues scattered throughout the building. Even the music is playing! Operators of the restaurant wear appropriate clothing for the setting.

Jabba's Palace: A larger fine dining area with various diverse places to sit in, including the throne room and torture chamber (where droid audio-animatronics lurk). More life-sized alien statues plus statues of mercenaries and bounty hunters are also here. There's even a statue of the crime lord himself in the throne room.

Blue Milkshakes: A scrappy-looking stand where coffee and special blue, green, and chocolate milkshakes can be bought.

Kat Saka's Kettle: Another stand to purchase popcorn, candy, and other snacks.

The Lost Conclave: A dark cave illuminated only by light-up crystals. Force ghosts of ancient Jedi guide guests in constructing their own lightsabers.

Lore Chamber: A side cave connected to the Conclave where guests can purchase Jedi or Sith Holocrons, artifacts, and pre-built lightsabers. For extra-immersion, both it and Lost Conclave run on self-checkout. The Holocrons you buy here can record and store messages.

Jawa Droid Depot: A sandcrawler-style shop filled with audio-animatronics and statues of both droids and Jawas where people can create and purchase their own droids.

Mokar Creature Shop: Aside from critter plushies and figures, this shop also offers alien masks.

Imperial Garrison: Contains merchandise and outfitting related to the Galactic Empire.

Rebel Storehouse: Contains selling merchandise and outfitting related to the Rebellion. Designed as sort of an underground hideout for Rebel supporters on Tatooine, and it's deliberately hard to find. You might want to ask a fellow guest or denizen for help, but don't ask the trooper patrols!

Dune Sea Outfitters: Allows guests to purchase outfitting for Tatooine and Outer Rim denizens.

Food: Did I say ""coffee""? ""milkshakes""? ""popcorn""? No, we have new names for our cuisine. Enjoy Fosh Nuggets, Kuat Fries, Blue and Green Milk, Kettle Kernels, and Mon Calamari. Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, and other real-world brands are also removed and replaced with new galactic alternatives such as Tibanna Soft Drink and Nar Shaddaa Special.

Denizens: Some statues of droids populate the area, as do civilians wearing alien masks and Outer Rim gear.

Guest Transport: An Imperial troop transport travels on a track across the area akin to a trolley. Guests can board and be ferried.

OT Meet and Greets: Occasional appearances by OT characters are also present here.

Imperial Presence: Cast members in this area are dressed like Imperial officers and security are dressed like Shock Troopers. You can even ask wandering Stormtrooper patrols for directions or help. - They will sometimes encourage you to find and crack down on Rebel supporters among the guests.

Alignment Effects: You will sometimes be noticed by troopers and questioned if you are a Rebel sympathizer. If you openly admit to or wear apparel that hints to being one, you will be approached and escorted out of the area. You have to keep your Rebellion alignment a secret if you want to have service at certain shops and restaurants or board TIE Fighter, and stay out of the open and away from trooper patrols. Pro-Imperial guests, on the other hand, cannot get service at the Rebel Storehouse or board Rebel Stand or Smuggler's Run without keeping their alignment a secret, but are still allowed to walk around freely. You can always state that you're neutral and simply not get any alignment effects.

&#x200B;

East Coast: Heart of the Galaxy

Setting: Coruscant, 19 BBY. Near the end of the Clone Wars, anti-CIS security is tighter than ever on the planet and the Republic's stricter laws begin its transition into the Empire. The question is: which side are you on? The architecture has a lot of fake Coruscant skyscrapers and is much more sleeker and metallic than Tatooine, with lots of neon lights that make it pretty at night.

&#x200B;

Gunship Cavalry: While it has the same pilot-gunner-engineer layout of Smuggler's Run, it instead focuses on taking down a droid offensive on Hypori with Commander Fordo as the host.

&#x200B;

Star Wars: The Coruscant Invasion: With the same technological scale of ROTR, the Coruscant Invasion is instead themed around the invasion of Coruscant and being caught in the middle of the kidnapping of Sheev, resulting in encounters with Mace Windu, Stass Allie, Shaak Ti, Foul Moudama, and General Grievous. The ride vehicle is a levi-car intended to evacuate the guests, only to get caught off track.

&#x200B;

Capital Down: A CIS-aligned dark ride, focusing on entering the Senate through the Coruscant underworld and planting a bomb, all while eluding Republic Security. It's not on the scale of The Coruscant Invasion, but still an entertaining ride.

&#x200B;

Coruscant Airspeeders: An outdoor-indoor rollercoaster going over the streets of Coruscant, with airspeeders being the vehicles.

&#x200B;

Dex's Diner: Well, whattaya know, it's finally open! Dex's serves plenty of all-American cuisine (under Star Wars names, of course) and has statues of waiter robots throughout the restaurant and even a statue of Dex himself at the bar. Blue, green, and chocolate milkshakes are served here, plus exclusive dishes such as the Revan Rip & Dip and Dacaroni.

&#x200B;

Outlander Club: An alcohol-based bar with a vibrant atmosphere. And you can buy some deathsticks, although they are actually flavored strawberry and lemon candy sticks. Undercover cast members will offer you free deathsticks.

&#x200B;

Donut Rings of Geonosis: Donuts, donut holes, bagels, wraps, coffee, and other breakfast goods are sold at this stand.

&#x200B;

Swytsir's Sweets: Candy, snacks, and deathsticks are sold at this stand.

&#x200B;

The Jedi Path: Part of a structure emulating the Jedi Temple. The Jedi Sentinels guide guests in constructing their own lightsabers.

&#x200B;

Jedi Archives: A side cave connected to the Jedi Path where guests can purchase Jedi or Sith Holocrons, artifacts, and pre-built lightsabers. The Holocrons you buy here can record and store messages.

&#x200B;

The Works: A factory-themed shop filled with audio-animatronics and statues of both droids and Geonosians where people can create and purchase their own droids.

&#x200B;

Galaxies Library: Sells EU books and comics, plus video games, tabletop games, and their supplements.

&#x200B;

Republic Armory: Contains merchandise and outfitting related to the Republic.

&#x200B;

League of Separatist Sympathizers: Contains merchandise and outfitting related to the CIS. Designed as sort of an underground hideout for CIS supporters on Coruscant, and it's deliberately hard to find. You might want to ask a fellow guest or denizen for help, but don't ask the trooper patrols!

&#x200B;

Worldly Apparel: Allows guests to purchase outfitting for Core World denizens.

&#x200B;

Food: Did I say ""coffee""? ""milkshakes""? ""popcorn""? No, we have new names for our cuisine. Enjoy Fosh Nuggets, Kuat Fries, Blue and Green Milk, Kettle Kernels, and Mon Calamari. Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, and other real-world brands are also removed and replaced with new galactic alternatives such as Tibanna Soft Drink and Nar Shaddaa Special.

&#x200B;

Denizens: Some statues of droids populate the area, as do civilians wearing more noble apparel. Some wear alien masks and makeup.

&#x200B;

Giant Holo-Boards: There are various holo-boards on walls featuring wanted posters for CIS leaders, advertisements, and even big ones featuring speeches by Palpatine.

&#x200B;

PT Meet and Greets: Occasional appearances by PT characters are also present here.

&#x200B;

Republic Presence: Cast members in this area are dressed like Republic officers and security are dressed like Shock Troopers. You can even ask wandering Clone Trooper patrols for directions or help. They will sometimes encourage you to find and crack down on CIS supporters among the guests.

&#x200B;

Alignment Effects: You will sometimes be noticed by troopers and questioned if you are a CIS sympathizer. If you openly admit to or wear apparel that hints to being one, you will be approached and escorted out of the area. You have to keep your CIS alignment a secret if you want to have service at certain shops and restaurants or board Gunship Cavalry or The Coruscant Invasion, and stay out of the open and away from trooper patrols. Pro-Republic guests, on the other hand, cannot get service at the League of Separatist Sympathizers or board Capital Down without keeping their alignment a secret, but are still allowed to walk around freely. You can always state that you're neutral and simply not get any alignment effects.

The sequels were super unnecessary, super lazy, and honestly undefendable, unless someone is being extremely nitpicky and petty. The sequels have nothing to do with the OT or Prequels. They basically took what shouldve happened with Luke Leia Han and all those characters after ROTJ and said “fuck that, lets do that for our newer, shittier, characters instead.” I personally enjoy the sequels. I like watching them. But when i sit down and think about it I wish they didnt exist. I’d like to salvage the characters and make a NEW story with good characters arcs and consistency, but other than that, fuck everything else.

I still don't understand or believe how he fell to the Dark Side, so I feel like his redemption was completely hollow.

With Vader in the Original Trilogy, it was easy to understand.  Vader was written as a terrible, selfish person. The only time he's not pursuing completely terrible, selfish ends was when he tries to convince Luke to join him because he's his son. Even that was a selfish proposal, but it showed the glimmer of Vader caring about someone else. Vader doesn't even try to do good or have any conflict about serving the Emperor until he actually sees Luke about to die.  I felt like the trilogy perfect sold the redemption. It doesn't try to make Vader conflicted or good in general.  It just makes him care enough about Luke to sacrifice himself for his son's sake.

I feel like the Prequel Trilogy just enforces this.  Anakin fell because he was selfish and myopically focused on his own wants. He was able to delude himself into believing his selfish desires were selfless but it was understandable why he did so. He was groomed by Palpatine (someone he reasonably thought he could trust) from a young age, suffered several traumas at an early age (growing up in slavery, having to leave his mother to slavery, going back only to helplessly watch her die) and then had to go serve in a bloody war through his formative young adult years.

Why did Kylo fall? He thought he could hear Vader in his mind? Why did he listen to or trust that voice? He had two loving parents and Luke. Why would he listen to a voice in his mind over their influences? The movies never give us a scene to explain from Kylo's perspective why he felt compelled to follow the words of a Sith he had been taught was evil and wrong.

So, Luke tried to kill him. Why would he then go join the First Order? There's a huge spectrum of life choices between ""be a Jedi"" and ""join the Space Nazis."" Rejecting Luke doesn't mean embracing Snoke.  It's not a binary choice. Anakin had a binary choice because Palpatine was so powerful and had complete control of the galaxy. The First Order was a minor fringe power at the time of Kylo's turn.

I just don't feel like the Han dream and Leia's Force help are sufficient explanations for Ben's redemption because all of it addresses Kylo's actions *after* he turned, but none of it addresses why Kylo turned in the first place. And unlike Vader, who's redemption was ultimately still rooted in his personal desire for family (which is what made it believable), Kylo's turn back to Ben is portrayed as a full on redemption back to the light side.",saltierthancrait,kylo isnt a good character i hear a lot of people praise kylos character as the good part of the sequel trilogy but i just dont see it  i still dont understand or believe how he fell to the dark side so i feel like his redemption was completely hollow vader in the original trilogy it was easy to understand  vader was written as a terrible selfish person the only time hes not pursuing completely terrible selfish ends was when he tries to convince luke to join him because hes his son even that was a selfish proposal but it showed the glimmer of vader caring about someone else vader doesnt even try to do good or have any conflict about serving the emperor until he actually sees luke about to die  i felt like the trilogy perfect sold the redemption it doesnt try to make vader conflicted or good in general  it just makes him care enough about luke to sacrifice himself for his sons sake feel like the prequel trilogy just enforces this  anakin fell because he was selfish and myopically focused on his own wants he was able to delude himself into believing his selfish desires were selfless but it was understandable why he did so he was groomed by palpatine someone he reasonably thought he could trust from a young age suffered several traumas at an early age growing up in slavery having to leave his mother to slavery going back only to helplessly watch her die and then had to go serve in a bloody war through his formative young adult years did kylo fall he thought he could hear vader in his mind why did he listen to or trust that voice he had two loving parents and luke why would he listen to a voice in his mind over their influences the movies never give us a scene to explain from kylos perspective why he felt compelled to follow the words of a sith he had been taught was evil and wrong luke tried to kill him why would he then go join the first order theres a huge spectrum of life choices between be a jedi and join the space nazis rejecting luke doesnt mean embracing snoke  its not a binary choice anakin had a binary choice because palpatine was so powerful and had complete control of the galaxy the first order was a minor fringe power at the time of kylos turn just dont feel like the han dream and leias force help are sufficient explanations for bens redemption because all of it addresses kylos actions after he turned but none of it addresses why kylo turned in the first place and unlike vader whos redemption was ultimately still rooted in his personal desire for family which is what made it believable kylos turn back to ben is portrayed as a full on redemption back to the light side,1,2717,493,1,0.158,0.694,0.148,-0.9379

I can't get over how dirty that they did Luke. Luke is not a wise master who lost everything...he is a psychopath, a coward, and someone who doesn't own up to his mistakes. Literally, everything that Luke Skywalker is not. 

Psychopath- He goes into a sleeping Kylo room and almost kills him. People make excuses about this like. Oh, it was only for a second or some stuff like that..but no, that is bad. This is like if batman saw Robin talking to the Joker one day, then he comes into his room, put a gun to his head cocks it back.. then stops himself. That is the equivalent of what Luke did. 

Luke went to a genocidal monster and said I could change you because I know there must be good in you. But he wants to murder his sleeping ward. 

People have tried to likening it to when he almost killed Vader. So after trying to talk to this guy who is waging a war, he attacks you, then says he will go after your sister. It is viewed as the same thing as killing someone in their sleep.They know in their hearts that isn't the same.  Hell beyond that he dropped his weapon. So that would mean that if you did think they were the same he didn't learn a thing over 40 years .

A coward, he messed up and he blamed the Jedi way. But he did literally the opposite of the Jedi, when he tried to murder someone. So he goes in to excel because he is a coward that will not admit that he did wrong and blames his religion. A religion that he didn't follow . 

Lastly he half heartily says he is sorry to Kylo in their last fight, then troll him. ""Everything you said was wrong "" cool line but at this point both of these people are in to some villainy. He should have spent that whole time trying to talk him down like a negotiator. 

And they say this is the best Luke has ever been ? Then you didn't like Luke to start with.  And it is nothing new, it is the wave of good characters going dark. Like a Superman movie with a color pattern of dark blues and grays. Where Pa Kent says maybe you should let your classmate die.

# To Start:

* We begin with a continuity reboot (again) that splits Episodes 1-6 and TCW into a new canon and the EU into the Legends canon, although the difference is that the Legends canon is allowed to continue alongside the new canon and the retcons made by TCW are undone and applied only to the new canon. The Infinities continuity is also established for stories that are non-canon to the saga.
* The comics field will receive a full relaunch with new #1s and be split up into eras - The Old Republic, Rise of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, and The New Republic.
* The EA deal is NOT made.

# The Roadmap

* Age of Rebellion, Rise of the Empire, and the New Republic are launched as the new wave of comics under Marvel. Related titles include character-centric comics that will even cross over at certain major events.
* A new Jedi Academy trilogy of books, introducing Luke's New Jedi Order into the new canon.
* Alphabet Squadron saga, a spiritual successor to the X-Wing series.
* The Aftermath trilogy details the formation of the New Republic and ends with the retaking of Coruscant in 7 ABY. Not written by Chuck Wendig.
* X-Wing & TIE Fighter are the first games to come out of the new canon, reboots of the classic flight sims with HD graphics, a new story told from both sides, online multiplayer, and optional VR features.
* Battlefront is also rebooted. The new game contains the OT, PT, and ST eras at first and continues to be updated with more content. The gameplay is also closer to classic BF.
* Tie-in books and one-shot comics to the upcoming Episode VII.
* **Episode VII released in theaters.**
* **Knights of the Old Republic: Part 1 is released directly to streaming - a loose, two-part adaptation of the first game to introduce the era to general audiences and see if a Legends story can sell onscreen.**
* Infinities comic relaunched and now covering the PT, ST, and EU as well.
* A ST tie-in animated series probably fleshing out the war with both OCs and film characters making appearances.
* Knights of the Old Republic: Legendary Edition is released to coincide with KOTOR Part 1, a remake of the classic game with modern graphics, revamped gameplay, and a new voice cast.
* KOTOR DLC for Battlefront.
* Tarkin novel released around this point.
* Rogue Squadron animated series adapting the X-Wing novels.
* Tie-in books and one-shot comics to the upcoming Rogue One.
* **Rogue One released in theaters.**
* **Heir to the Empire animated adaptation released directly to streaming, with subsequent parts of the Thrawn Trilogy being released as time goes on.**
* Rogue One DLC for Battlefront.
* **Bane of the Sith: Direct-to-streaming movie reintroducing the story of Darth Bane into canon.**
* **Knights of the Old Republic: Part 2: The second part of the direct-to-streaming KOTOR1 adaptation. A Special Edition combining both parts into one long film will be released on DVD.**
* KOTOR2: Legendary Edition is released with revamped graphics and gameplay to accompany the release of Part 2. It also reintegrates the incomplete content from the original game.
* New Thrawn novel trilogy: Reintroducing Thrawn into canon with Thrawn, Thrawn: Alliances, and Thrawn: Treason.
* Grievous solo novel: Adapting his Legends origin into the new canon.
* Black Sun novel trilogy: Reintroduces Xizor and his dealings with the galaxy into canon.
* **Shadows of the Empire: Animated adaptation of SOTE with a theatrical release. This is a test run to see if animated Star Wars films can still sell in theaters after TCW's failure.**
* Underworld live-action series focusing on the seedy side of the galaxy, with elements such as the Hutts and Black Sun.
* Shadows of the Empire: Legendary Edition remakes the classic action game with modern graphics and gameplay, plus a new voice cast from the film.
* Empire at War: Legendary Edition is another HD revamp of a classic game, with Forces of Corruption built in.
* Thrawn Trilogy DLC for Battlefront
* Inferno Squad novel trilogy, retooled to fit the Galactic Civil War ending in 19 ABY.
* Jedi Praxeum animated series adapting the Legends Jedi Academy trilogy.
* Tie-in books and one-shot comics to the upcoming Episode VII.
* **Episode VIII released in theaters.**
* Episode VIII DLC for Battlefront.
* Animated Infinities series now with additional what-if scenarios such as Emperor Vader and Qui-Gon Jinn surviving.
* Star Wars: Destinies interactive video game adapting Episodes 1-6, but the choices you make determine how the story plays out.
* Warlords: Geopolitical MMO about controlling your own Imperial warlord state, forming alliances, and waging wars.
* **Mara Jade anthology film released direct-to-streaming, reintroducing her to the general audience and featuring her days as the Emperor's Hand attempting to assassinate a traitor to the Empire.** 
* **Specter of the Past animated adaptation, with Vision of the Future released later on. VOTF has a loose adaptation of Union added on as an epilogue.**
* Jedi Academy: Legendary Edition has revamped graphics and gameplay for modern consoles.
* New Jedi Knights is an action game centering on Luke’s pupils in the new canon.

* Battlefront II reboot released, with all previous DLC built in, new modes and maps, separate campaigns for every faction, plus the ability to create and share custom maps online.
* Young Jedi Knights animated series adapting the Legends novels.
* **Palpatine anthology film released in theaters. Loosely adapting his early life and mentorship with Darth Plagueis the Wise, it is a test to see if a villain-led film will sell.**
* Dawn of the Jedi/Age of the Sith are a pair of games, much like X-Wing & TIE Fighter, that tell the same story from different sides in the Old Republic era. No defections in AOTS!
* **Vector Prime is adapted as a pilot movie for the NJO animated adaptation. Will only be released once every other post-Endor animated project is finished.**
* The New Jedi Order will be a long-running animated series adapting the novel saga. Like its pilot movie, it will only be released when every other post-Endor animated project is finished.

* **The Unifying Force is adapted as a finale movie for the NJO animated series, serving as a conclusion to the ""Star Wars Legends Animated Universe"" that had been built up to that point.**
* LEGO Star Wars IV: The Saga Lives On adapts all nine films into the traditional LEGO game format, plus the anthologies, games, and TV series as bonus levels and DLC. 
* For those who want the sequels as George intended, a Lucas Cut novel trilogy will be released adapting it, plus an accompanying audio drama.

I loved the idea of “let the past die,” but had trouble with the execution. 

Had that been the theme of the sequels from the getgo, I think it could have worked. Leia tried running a Republic much like the original one but with a “pure” heart instead of Palpatine. Luke tried emulating the old Jedi Order because Yoda and friends told him that was the way. Han can’t escape the thrills he gets working missions instead of retiring. First Order is motivated by the legacy Palpatine and Vader left behind. 

The first movie could have set all of that up and shown how imperfect it was. Corruption in the senate and failed Jedi teachings set up the drama to come. Episode 8 would have been the lowest point. And then episode 9 would have shown the New Republic and Jedi Order learning from those mistakes. Luke truly creates a New Jedi Order. 

I’ll let smarter people than me dictate specific plots and such. But that they said “let the past die” and then went all the way back to fan service and the past was so, so, so stupid.

491,Why were we suppose to be impressed and inspired by Luke in The Force Awakens?,54,iw6011,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/iw6011/why_were_we_suppose_to_be_impressed_and_inspired/,11,1600598999.0,"Something I realized a while ago around the same time I rewatched The Force Awakens with the intent to make a more detailed analysis of the movie was that if you have no idea who Luke is when watching The Force Awakens you really don’t have any reasons at all to be impressed or inspired by him because the movie itself really doesn’t give you any reasons to.

This what we are told about Luke in TFA:

* He vanished

* He is the last Jedi(But the movie doesn’t explain what a Jedi is)

* His Jedi(whatever that is)academy was destroyed by one of his students.

* He felt responsible and decided to run away from it all abandoning his friends and family.

* The people closed to him THINK(as in SPECULATING, THEORIZING, not a certainty) that he went looking for the first Jedi Temple

* He and his father had a lightsaber that is now in the possession of some orange gremlin.

Does this guy sound inspiring in any way? I don’t think so. But the movie assumes that the audience already cares about Luke so it doesn’t really bother to give us reasons to by inspired by Luke. This assumptions might be true for a large part of the audience but for the audience in China and other countries that as no nostalgic connections to the OT this will just be confusing because they won’t get why finding this bearded man who abandon his friends and family is so important.

Compare this to what A New Hope tells us about Luke’s father:

* He was the best star fighter pilot in the Galaxy(might be a bit hyperbolical but the point remains he was a good pilot).

* A cunning warrior.

* A Jedi Knight (and the movie also actually explains what a Jedi is: guardians of peace and justice of the old republic)

* A good friend of Ben Kenobi

* He was betrayed and murdered by Darth Vader who was a student of Ben that was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

Now this guy actually sounds inspiring and you can understand why Luke would want to become a Jedi like him.

So the A New Hope actually gives the characters and the audience a reason to look up to Luke’s father while The Force Awakens just assumes that the audience already likes and cares about Luke and therefor doesn’t bothered building him up properly throughout the movie.

Also the reasons we are given in The Force Awakens for why people need to find Luke really doesn’t make a lot of sense

Do they need him to train new jedi to fight the First Order? 

Well there are three problems with this:

1. The Rebel Alliance in ANH was willing to fight the empire even though they did not have any force users on their side. Are you telling me that the leadership of the Resistance is so weak that they don’t dare to fight a much weaker enemy than the empire unless they have Jedi on their side even though the Resistance should be way more powerful than the Rebels were 30 years ago given that they are (supposedly) supported by the existing government?
L

2. The movie made it clear that Luke’s previous academy was destroyed and all of students were killed so why would the Resistance be so confident that finding Luke  will fix things when his first academy was a total failure?

3. Even if Luke is found and is willing to train new Jedi it should take him several years to train new Jedi if we go by the OT and this is later also severely undermined by Rey mastering the force in less than an afternoon. This could have been solved if the movie PROPERLY established that Rey sudden Force skills is out of the ordinary but since it didn’t new audiences who have no frame of reference for how quickly one masters the Force is now going to be confused why finding Luke is even relevant if anyone who is strong in the Force can use it instantly without any training. If you can’t understand the problem with this image this: image you watching a Chinese fantasy movie were the main plot is about a finding an old Kung Fu master who the movie established vanished after his Kung fu school was destroyed and they need to find him so that he can gain new kung fu fighters but than suddenly the peasant protagonist who just found out that Kung Fu is thing can suddenly use Kung Fu just hours after finding out about it and no one in the movie acts like this is out of the ordinary. That is the problem with this.

**Do they need him to defeat Kylo?**

Well Rey and Chewie defeats him in the movie so he wasn’t necessary for that either. If Kylo can be defeated by a non-force sensitive wookie and a girl who just became aware of the force and never hold a lightsaber before than the Resistance didn’t need to spend years trying to find Luke so he could accomplish that.

**Do they need him to destroy Starkiller Base?**

Well the Resistance was not aware of Starkiller Base until it destroyed the New Republic’s Capital Systems so they couldn’t have been searching for him so he could do that and Star Starkiller Base was taken out by a team of non-force users so no Luke wasn’t necessary for that either.

The idea that the Resistance would waste all their time and resources to find Luke really doesn’t make much sense especially if you go by the OT.

In the OT Luke was very important to the Rebel alliance no doubt but they were never dependent on him. When Luke goes missing on Hoth do they risk hundreds of Rebel soldiers to go out and find him in the snow storm? No they wait until the storm is over and accepts that if Luke has died it is tragic but they must carry on.

When Luke goes to get trained by Yoda do the Rebel alliance panic and spend all their time and resources into finding him? No they carry on as usual.

When the rebels was planning the attack on Death Star II do the team that was going to Endor say that they can’t go unless Luke goes with them? No they were actually planning to go there without him. Luke just shows up and says that he will join them in the last minute.

When Luke goes to confront Vader and the Emperor does the Rebel team on Endor panic and says that they can’t do it without Luke? No they carry on as usual.

If the Resistance was anything like the OT Rebel alliance they would have focused their energy on fighting the FO instead of wasting time and manpower to finding Luke who may or may not be dead at this point.

Luke was never this messiah-like character to the Rebels. He was a good pilot that destroyed the Death Star and they were very grateful to him for it but they never expected him to win the entire war for them alone.

Some might say that maybe he obtained this messiah-like status in between ANH and TFA but that status should have been severely diminished when his academy was destroyed and he just vanishes without leaving an explanation for why he left. Seriously given what he are told about Luke in TFA we are not actually given much reasons to care about him.

This week we got our first look at the new season of The Mandalorian. 

What are your hopes, dreams, predictions and theories for the second season? 

Does Baby Yoda go through Space Puberty?

Does the titular Mando get serious about his relationship with the Razer Crest?

Does Cara Dune get a hot makeover sequence? 

Does Luke Skywalker show up?

And most importantly: do they keep Sequel Trilogy references out of the mouths of the main characters?

The only evidence for this mind you, is that in TFA a Razorcrest class ship can be seen in the woods of Maz's castle and supposedly someone says that they saw something about Ahsoka having a blue saber.

I don't want to panic over so little, but the idea of linking the Mandalorian into the plotline of the reboots pisses me off soooooooo much.

First of all, I just want to forget the reboots and I can't do that with Mando bringing it up.

Second, it's not going to fix Maz 'absent-because-of-a-trade-dispute' Kanata as a character or the absurdity of that saber being just dropped into TFA.

And most importantly, it will make Mandalorian feel like a glorified connect-the-dots scavenger hunt, which is what ruined Solo for me. Mando is its own thing and succeeded so well last season because it took a parallel path to the main story, showing us the declining Empire and the bounty hunter culture and expanding on it without tying it into what we already know.

EXT. A PLANET FAR, FAR AWAY FROM GREEN MILK UDDERS

We see a tread-speeder (a NEW speeder with rubber, caterpillar tracks) flying through space to the planet of Keff Biff, a desert planet where the sand is water. We zoom in and see it is piloted by REY, with a cool, calm and collected demeanour.

INT. REY’S TREAD-SPEEDER

Finn, a janitor, walks up to Rey, and it looks like he wants to ask her a question. Mr. Staircase the Porg waddles by.  Finally, Finn speaks.

Finn: RRRRREEEEEEEEEYYYYY!

Rey: Everyone talks to me like they understand me. But I know how to fly without you. I can take care of myself. (She says this with a cool, calm and collected expression) 


INT. KEF BIFF FIRST ORDER SUPER-DEATH-STAR-KILLER MARK XII

Kylo Ren kneels before the SOCK DRAWER of DARTH VADER.

Kylo Ren: I feel it again. I am conflicted. Show me the power of the past, grandfather, so I can let myself die. 

As Kylo Ren stands up, his own sock, just like DARTH VADER’S, falls off. Kylo takes one look at it, ignites his saber and utterly destroys it in a fit of uncontrolled rage. 

Two stormtroopers are about to walk in when they see Kylo. They walk out, backwards. Canned laughter plays in this scene, alongside a “wa wa waaaaaaaa!” Trombone sound effect.

Suddenly, REY walks in, clearly emanating a cool, calm and collected aura, surprising Kylo. 

Kylo Ren: I am ALL THE SITH! [He starts firing X-Wings, Naboo Starfighters and AT-M6’s out of his hands. In his anger, they are all focused on Rey, allowing the rest of the REBELS to hide]

Rey: And I...have a message. FOR YOUR MOTHER!!!!! [Rey snarls, screaming and roaring as Kylo is pushed back, viciously stabbing and swinging with her weapon. Rey does this in a cool, calm and collected manner]

Kylo melts in a pure, unimaginable spike of rage. Finn turns to the camera, and conveys a heartfelt and beautiful message about how far they’ve come since their first meeting, all those days ago.

Finn: RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! 

Rose Tico leaves because her planet needs her.

518,I'll give TLJ this: The trailer was very good... DECEPTIVELY good,124,ivh59r,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ivh59r/ill_give_tlj_this_the_trailer_was_very_good/,29,1600500593.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CbN8sfihY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CbN8sfihY)

So I found my way back to the TLJ trailer when watching a retroactive reactionary video, and I have to say this trailer really sold us on a movie that we thought would be infinitely better than what we got. I don't know who all edited the trailer, but I hope they got a good pay because Disney and Lucasfilm most certainly got their money's worth out of these guys.

The trailer gave us a great mix of action from the opening space dogfight, the speeder battle at the end on Crait, the duel between Finn and Phasma. It also posed very important questions like if Kylo Ren was really going to kill Leia, what Rey's lineage is and if she's going to turn evil, what tragedies happened in the past, how will all of these characters and plots develop, and what is going on with Luke Skywalker. We had action, drama, a small bit of comedy with the porg but not excessive by any stretch, and posed questions we wanted answered and were excited to see the result. Best of all, we had the great John Williams score to make you even more pumped.

And then Rian Johnson went and subverted all of our expectations.

We either got no answers, really bad answers, or the context of these scenes were just plain stupid. No character development, total character assassination of Luke Skywalker, forced MCU-esque humor that doesn't fit nor does it land, and the story itself... well, we know the rest at this point. I also can't help but notice that the trailer didn't portray Luke as being character assassinated, just ambiguous in nature. It's not only insulting what they did to Luke, but the intention were just plain evil (they wanted to knock him down to elevate Rey).

Not only that, but the trailer actually excludes both Rose Tico and Admiral Holdo, despite them being important characters in the movie. I think even the trailer team knew that featuring them would look bad, because of how awful their characters were on all levels. Certain scenes give the impression of a different context than what was in the movie. Rey giving Luke her lightsaber seems dramatic, as opposed to the most infamous ""GOTCHA!"" ever. Finn's fight with Phasma looks like an intense and personal development, not an idiotic scene involving two badly-written characters. The opening space battle seems like classic Star Wars, but instead was just a total mess that gave way for the shittiness to come.

I can go on and on.

Anyways, for as bad as The Last Jedi was, the trailer was phenomonal and helped get us in the theaters to watch an awesome movie that would unite the fanbase once again, blissfully ignorant of our true fate.

I hope subverting our expectations was worth all the pain and misery that followed for you, Lucasfilm and Disney, Rian.",saltierthancrait,ill give tlj this the trailer was very good deceptively good  i found my way back to the tlj trailer when watching a retroactive reactionary video and i have to say this trailer really sold us on a movie that we thought would be infinitely better than what we got i dont know who all edited the trailer but i hope they got a good pay because disney and lucasfilm most certainly got their moneys worth out of these guys trailer gave us a great mix of action from the opening space dogfight the speeder battle at the end on crait the duel between finn and phasma it also posed very important questions like if kylo ren was really going to kill leia what reys lineage is and if shes going to turn evil what tragedies happened in the past how will all of these characters and plots develop and what is going on with luke skywalker we had action drama a small bit of comedy with the porg but not excessive by any stretch and posed questions we wanted answered and were excited to see the result best of all we had the great john williams score to make you even more pumped then rian johnson went and subverted all of our expectations either got no answers really bad answers or the context of these scenes were just plain stupid no character development total character assassination of luke skywalker forced mcuesque humor that doesnt fit nor does it land and the story itself well we know the rest at this point i also cant help but notice that the trailer didnt portray luke as being character assassinated just ambiguous in nature its not only insulting what they did to luke but the intention were just plain evil they wanted to knock him down to elevate rey only that but the trailer actually excludes both rose tico and admiral holdo despite them being important characters in the movie i think even the trailer team knew that featuring them would look bad because of how awful their characters were on all levels certain scenes give the impression of a different context than what was in the movie rey giving luke her lightsaber seems dramatic as opposed to the most infamous gotcha ever finns fight with phasma looks like an intense and personal development not an idiotic scene involving two badlywritten characters the opening space battle seems like classic star wars but instead was just a total mess that gave way for the shittiness to come can go on and on for as bad as the last jedi was the trailer was phenomonal and helped get us in the theaters to watch an awesome movie that would unite the fanbase once again blissfully ignorant of our true fate hope subverting our expectations was worth all the pain and misery that followed for you lucasfilm and disney rian,1,2880,494,1,0.161,0.682,0.157,-0.8767

528,A thankyou and goodbye to this sub,254,iv5yow,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/iv5yow/a_thankyou_and_goodbye_to_this_sub/,47,1600464099.0,"I'm not even sure if this kind of post is allowed. If it gets removed, I understand.

This place, and all of you, really helped me cope with this horrendous trilogy. Unlike some of you, I did not hate the force awakens. It was definitely not what I wanted, and by no means is it even a great film, but to me it was all right. I still had some hope that the future of Star Wars could go in a good direction and be enjoyable.

Then the Last Jedi came out and I was blown away. Blown Away with how succinctly and completely they had destroyed Star Wars for me. I will never forget the way I felt my heart sinking after that movie ended. I am sure most of you don't need to imagine my surprise, because you also lived it, when going online to look up how others felt about the film and seen so much praise and love. Seeing so many people ignore the flaws.  It was like the critics and reviewers were ignoring the rest of the context of all of Star Wars and treating this as a standalone film. 

The reactions and push back I got, when trying to discuss my problems with the movie and other subs, made me kind of feel like I was crazy. I can accept that people loved the film. It was kind of nuts to me that anyone did but I could accept it. I just wanted to be able to have a fair discussion about what I saw as serious flaws. But all I received back were attacks as did anyone who agreed with me. I even re-watched the damn thing, thinking maybe I missed some key things or I was misinterpreting. But no, that damn movie was just as awful if not more, than I remembered.

Luckily for me, when I got to a point that I was practically just pleading for honest discussion in comments about that movie, someone pointed me towards this sub. What a godsend that turned out to be.

Just seeing a bunch of people who felt the same or close to it was massively helpful. It made it much easier to spot the propaganda and narrative being pushed to defend this garbage. Sure there are plenty of disagreements here. Not all of us agree on Which movie was the worst, or exactly what ruined the franchise. But even among the arguments here, the discussion was vastly better than anywhere else I had seen on Reddit. People actually Converse here in good faith about these movies.

You lot also led me to find some great enjoyable YouTube channels and content that allowed me to at least get some enjoyment out of this garbage Trilogy, even if it was from laughing at it and how horrible it was.  Sure, I disagreed with plenty of people here. And at times I got quite frustrated with many of you being unwilling to stop giving Disney money, especially for Star Wars related things. But even my worst experiences here were infinitely better than discussing this Trilogy anywhere else on Reddit.

I feel like at this point I just don't have anything left to vent about these movies anymore. I'm so glad the trilogy is done and over with. I'm glad the last movie was a piece of shit that annoy a lot of the remaining fans of that trilogy. At least they had to feel a bit of what I felt watching The Last Jedi destroy one of my favorite childhood experiences.  I just don't have any interest in the Mandalorian or any more Star Wars. I feel totally drained on the subject. I'm just going to stick with the first 6 movies, some of the shows and the games and the books and the things I still love. So I think at this point I am better off just trying to put it all behind me and forget it. As much as I still enjoy this sub, it is still just a reminder anytime I see it that this awful Trilogy exists, and what it did to the franchise.

Thank you all very much for this place to ease some of the damage these movies did. I may end up back here, but either way, you all have been great.

Also I did this whole thing with speech to text, so I apologize for any errors. I tried to catch what I could.

They replied ""sorry you're so cynical"". 

For some reason I remembered this today and I went ""Why?"" 

Why did they make such an assumption about my character - me, a complete stranger on the Internet - based on one comment? A comment about a movie of all things. 

I loathe cynicism. I spend every day fighting my own pain and anger to believe in something. To find meaning. To have hope. I am nothing but a hopeless romantic. In so many ways, it drove me to star wars. 

And I'm cynical for not liking the films that portrayed the heroes who grew and suffered as a group of horrible people and failures with no achievements? 

I'm cynical for not liking the films that destroy everything positive that came before them because ""life"" as some people told me? The films that disguise cynicism as realism? 

I'm not writing this to garner pity or sympathy or even to call out this person. I'm just disturbed. 

Why are we so quick to judge eachother based on the smallest things? Why are we so quick with the assumptions? 

I know the Internet is a shitty place. I've taken far worst bricks and stones on it. I'm not complaining or whining. I'm just disturbed. And maybe not cynical enough.

This is a LONG list.

&#x200B;

**The Force Awakens**

1. To give Rey depth, we should've seen her suffer just a little bit on Jakuu. Maybe one of those bullies she fights at Niima Outpost lands a hit on her, or something. We see her in a harsh environment, but no matter what happens, she is largely unaffected. Disney thinks Rey is inspiring because of her 'tenacity'. Doesn't true tenacity mean bouncing back after a sharp hardship like that?
2. Hux, or Snoke, who I'll get to later, needed more development. With all Kylo's bluntness, we needed a nuanced villain somewhere.
3. We needed to see a LOT more of the New Republic. It would actually give us a sense of what the Resistance is fighting for, and why the New Republic was a noble attempt, a necessary spot of order and hope of the galaxy organizing again against the military brutality of the First Order. The Legends New Republic got the place it deserved, but it's easy to forget that the Disney New Republic ever existed.
4. We should have had some indication that Finn was Force sensitive, ideally when he was fighting with the Skywalker Saber. This little inconsistency opens a world of plot holes and missed opportunities in itself, namely his secret in Episode IX. Everyone thought it was that he loved Rey, and it's hard to think otherwise unless you read the TRoS novelization, and good directors don't rely on outside writers to save their movies.
5. It should've been a LOT harder for the heroes to defeat Kylo Ren. How it played out might actually have been better for consistency with the next movie, but a years-trained Force warrior beaten by two untrained kids passing a lightsaber around, how does that make sense? Though the bowcaster wound on his leg did help.
6. The scene in which Hux picks up Kylo after he is defeated should have been in the theater version. I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. To understand the next movie clearly, the average viewer has to know that Kylo survives and that Snoke is important. True, Star Wars should always have benefits in reading/watching extra material, but this just made the fully-enjoyed fanbase smaller.
7. R2-D2 should have been more prevalent, though this applies to the entire Disney trilogy. According to George Lucas, the Star Wars saga is a story told by R2-D2, and R2 would have to have seen it firsthand to make it as detailed as the other movies, when R2 is turned off for over %90 of this one. (Although that does help explain why this movie was so bad.)

**The Last Jedi**

1. Captain Phasma needed more story. She should've tried something against the Resistance while they were fleeing through space. She looked like a promising character, but she just showed up to say some things and then die, wasted not unlike Boba Fett, Emperor Palpatine, and, whom I will get soon, Snoke.
2. The movie should have had a more quietly suspenseful feel that comes from things like all the tactical considerations of being pursued through space. Instead, it had run-around, non-stop action feel that makes the movie feel tiring and childish. Some pause should have come from the presumed slowness of all that time in space, but instead, they had something blow up every ten minutes, which made the action scenes less impactful. I'll admit that this isn't the worst feel for a movie in the holiday lineup, but overall, I think we can agree that holding up past the release and consistency with the rest of the franchise are much more important in a film.
3. The porgs! They were one of the movie's strong points and we only get a few glimpses of them.
4. Snoke needed more backstory. He represented an entirely new order of Dark Side users; showing more of his culture would have been instrumental to sequels depth. But he literally sits in an empty room.
5. Now, I don't hate or even dislike Rose; in my opinion she had one of the best character expositions of the sequels and was about as developed as Padmé, but maybe she should have died in her coma. This would be one of the two paths I have in mind to complete her as a character. This would make her sacrifice truer, especially considering how she technically failed to both kill what she hated and protect what she loved. Additionally, it would make her character presence and message more unique, especially considering how, although they didn't know this at the time, that she would hardly be used in TRoS anyway. Not to mention that putting one of the main characters into a coma is a clichéd trick that they ended the last movie with, though I might be a little more biased on this given how I thought she was dead when I first saw the movie.
6. The fight scene between Rey, Kylo, and Snoke's guards should have taken a little longer. It feels rushed after you've seen it once or twice.

**The Rise of Skywalker**

1. We should have seen more of Maz. She's a deep character as far as the sequels go, and her influence would be nearly perfect for explaining where all those Resistance ally ships came from.
2. The Knights of Ren had a lot of missed potential. Potentially, they could have been a secondary force to replace Captain Phasma and keep Kylo Ren in check. They could have looked a bit cooler and have had an interesting, warrior-cultist culture, too, to at least slightly living up to what they'd been built up to be for the last four years.
3. C-3PO or Chewbacca or some other main character (in addition to Leia) should have legitimately died. It would add untellable weight and realism to the final struggle of the Skywalker Saga, been a much better way to add suspense to the mission than some in-the-background time limit, and show that Disney is willing to give up a few merchandising possibilities for the sake of the story, which, apparently, it was not. Having the Millenium Falcon destroyed would be another way to add some real feeling.
4. Rose needed a lot more development in this, my second way to complete the character. She got enough backstory in TLJ to give her a 'good, but not great' personality. (By sequels standards, at least.) But she still needed a lot of work, namely being faced with endgame or otherwise very dangerous situations and some character flaws. Maybe fifteen minutes of time on-screen could have finished it for her.
5. The Resistance should have had more of a base in The Rise of Skywalker than just a few tents and parked ships. The Resistance never really got to build a base themselves and they missed a big chance to show the culture of the Resistance, though this might show something about the Resistance that they chose to live close to nature, and a small, scattered base like this would be harder to detect.
6. The Resistance should have acted more like heros than purgers. The Final Order worked tirelessly for decades building their strength, and then some kids with a few plot holes on their side flew in,  killed every single person involved, and destroyed their lives' work. Rey brings down a cathedral on thousands of fanatics she knows nothing about, when the Final Order actually could have been a step forward for the galaxy.
7.  Rey's lightsaber should have had a new color or design. It would have made Rey seem more individual, but I mostly want this so it wouldn't be yellow. Before this, yellow lightsabers were one of those things you couldn't find in 'mainstream' Star Wars. Little cool things like that were your reward for diving deeper, but then they gave it to a mainstream audience, many members of which didn't know that yellow lightsabers had existed in Star Wars before this or that they're supposed to be for Temple Guards. I have the same problem with the showing of the Darksaber in *The Mandalorian*, but it served plot purpose, and the lore behind how it got there will probably be explained in Season Two. But taking things from the obscure sides of Star Wars and placing them right in the Skywalker Saga just because they're cool damages the very idea of an expanded universe, a metaphor for Disney's entire plan. They didn't want to respect old Star Wars or enrich the universe as a whole. They were out to make money movies, no matter what that might mean for the rest of the franchise.",saltierthancrait,"every missed opportunity in the sequels that i can think of the sequels have an unknown large number of flaws and taking these opportunities wouldnt fix them but ive collected some of the most gaping sorted by movie and general time in the movie they affect this is a long list force awakens to give rey depth we shouldve seen her suffer just a little bit on jakuu maybe one of those bullies she fights at niima outpost lands a hit on her or something we see her in a harsh environment but no matter what happens she is largely unaffected disney thinks rey is inspiring because of her tenacity doesnt true tenacity mean bouncing back after a sharp hardship like that

First off let’s look at the plot of two trilogies, the prequels tell the story of the Jedi Order and The republic before the time of ANH. We see Anakins slow descent to the dark side and we see how the Republic and Jedi Order fell and Palpatines rise to power. Now let’s look at the plot of the DT, The empire is back again because reasons unexplained, Han, Luke and Leia become failures and their hard earned victory in ROTJ is deemed obsolete, The order never fully recovered from Order 66, and Palpatine was actually alive this whole time and finally Marey Sue palpatine bends the rules of the universe and kills Palpatine again and a Palpatine steals the skywalker name after the family bloodline becomes extinct and worst of all buries their lightsabers on a planet that the family had the worst memories on. Now which plot is worse?

2.The characters in the prequels are leagues better than the characters from the DT and it’s not even a contest. The prequels have Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Padme Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, An actual smart Palpatine, Mace Windu, Grandmaster Yoda, and whether you like him or not, Jar Jar. And The DT has Marey Sue, Finn, Poe, Rose, Jannah? Yea the DT has pretty forgettable characters and have non existent character arcs. Do you really think people are gonna be talking about Finn, Poe, Rose and Holdo in 10 years? Now let’s look at villains, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, General Grievous, Jango Fett, Freakin Nute Gunray, and a Genius Palpatine. Now let’s look at the DT villains, Kylo Ren, Hux, Snoke, Phasma, and a bastardized Dollar Store  version of Palpatine. Yeah all of the DT villains don’t even hold a candle to the prequel villains.

3. The worldbuilding in the prequels was on steroids, you have planets like Naboo, Coruscant, Geonosis, Kamino, Kashyyyk, Utapau, Mustafar and then you have DT planets that are all incredibly generic and ripoffs of planets in the OT. Hell even stuff in the prequel planets have worldbuilding like Otoh Gunga, Theed, Tipoca City, Senate dome, etc. Even the ship designs of the prequels are original and unique.

And for aliens: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/7mi5es/alien_design_prequels_vs_sequels/

4.The score between the prequels and DT is not even comparable:

Now compare this with the boring overused OT music in the DT. (I will admit Kylos theme is cool but doesn’t even come close to any of the above )


5.The same goes with the lightsaber duels, combat, and space battles, they’re not even comparable 

6.There are little to no emotional or sad moments at all during the DT (besides Hans death but that was incredibly cheap) and this something I don’t see anyone talk about, Just look at these scenes from the prequels

6. Since the internet circlejerk tells us that the prequels have nothing but bad dialogue here’s some good dialogue, now try to find dialogue in the DT that’s on par or better than these
 
“But not at the expense of the moment, be mindful of the living force young Padawan”

“Your focus determines your reality”

“At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi, at last we will have our revenge”

“Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering”

“Whenever you gamble my friend, eventually you will lose”

“Be brave and don’t look back”

“I’m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe”

“The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it”

“We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what’s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it”

“The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural” (It was so good that TROS bastardized this line)

“Not from a Jedi”

“I’m not the Jedi I should be, I want more and I know I shouldn’t”

“Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Jedi and the Sith are alike in almost every way”

“Ever since I’ve known you you’ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi. A life of significance, of conscience”

“He’s too dangerous to be kept alive” (yes I like this line unironically”)

“So this is how liberty dies.... with thunderous applause”

“Only a Sith deals in absolutes” (I unironically like this line too)

George Lucas"", a film by the Star Wars fanbase about everything George Lucas did wrong with Star Wars, most of the points prequels-related.

Although I am a prequels fan, there was something oddly satisfying about that movie for me. It shows  fans as capable of having a valid, presentable voice, maybe.

TPvGL, made a year before Disney took over, ends with a fan basically asking for another Star Wars movie.

We’re expected to believe that a Dark Side user trainer by Luke is beaten up by someone who never heard of the force before? Come on. (And I don’t care if he was “injured” because 1) That’s a stupid idea anyway-imagine if Chewie shot Vader in IV, and Luke beat up Vader with ease...that movie becomes 10x worse, and 2) Kylo was still intact enough to fight with his Lightsaber...so long as he’s not utterly incapacitated, he should have still been able to wipe the floor with Rey).

But the worst aspect of this is it makes our protagonist far stronger than the primary antagonist of the series. If our hero is already stronger than the villain, why should we feel any tension when they fight in the future? A story is only as good as its villain, and if you have a weak villain you have a weak story.

This is a huge misstep by JJ Abrams, no two ways about it, and we can’t blame VIII for it existing, nor can we let JJ off the hook for this frankly amateurish, bad-fanfic level mistake. However, we CAN blame VIII for not trying to fix it. 
And there’s a simple fix that could have solved this problem. Have Kylo turn to the light side...but have Rey turn to the dark.

Now, the story becomes flipped: Rey has already been proven to be stronger than Kylo, so having Kylo turn good but Rey turn evil means that their relative power has turned from a boring and stupid hero>villain dynamic to a suddenly tense and frighting villain>hero dynamic. And moving into IX, we’d all be asking ourselves “Will Rey destroy Kylo? Will Kylo defeat Rey? Or will Kylo redeem Rey? Or will Kylo turn back to the dark side?” There would be so many ways for the story to go. 

PS. After watching TFA and being more disappointed in it than any other film in my life, I came up with this theory as a desperate way to fix that absolute trash fire. However, I was 99% convinced that VIII would be a steaming pile of garbage considering that VII proved Disney had hired terrible writers for Star Wars.

After all, if he just wanted to die, why not go to some completely uncharted planet in the middle of nowhere? Why the First Jedi Temple? Not to mention that giving up like that after one attempt goes completely against his character. But this has all been said before.

I've thought of something cooler. Imagine this:

Luke tried to restart the Jedi Order multiple times, but kept getting attacked by Imperial Remnant warlords, neo-Sith cults like the Knights of Ren, Pirates, criminal organizations, militias and assassins sent by corrupt politicians, basically everyone who would want the Jedi to stay gone. Some of the students survived, but there were heavy losses, as well as several turning to the dark side.

The New Republic military offered to send a larger force to protect the Jedi Academy, but Luke initially turned the offer down, saying that with the Republic's very limited resources and the still unstable post-Imperial galaxy, their forces would be better used to maintain the peace.

Eventually, he's forced to accept, but the rearranging of forces leaves some areas on the fringes of the galaxy undermanned, allowing several small Imperial splinter groups to unite into the First Order. Though, of course, it's nowhere near the absurdly-powerful-with-seemlingly-unlimited-resources juggernaut that we see in the existing films.

When Ben Solo turns to the dark side and destroys the academy, Luke decides that he's doing things all wrong, and vanishes.

Here's the fun part: After Rey gets the map and follows it, we learn that DOZENS of people have followed various trails of breadcrumbs over the last decade, but *none have ever returned.* That's why Rey was chosen over Leia or Poe.

It turns out that Luke's new plan, after getting betrayed and/or attacked so many times, is to set up a system to make sure only those who are worthy can reach him. Or at least, if bad guys find him, it will be a small enough force that he can take them all out himself.

When they do find them, he trains them one on one or in small groups, then sends them off uphold justice, protect the innocent, and stop the bad guys in the shadows, anonymously. Like Space Batmen. That's right, Luke's new idea is to build and operate the New Jedi Order *in secret.* After so many attacks, and not wanting to be shackled to a potentially corruptable government, he decides it's better to keep the Jedi hidden. Like the Dunedain Rangers in Lord of the Rings, keeping the Hobbits safe and in ignorance of the horrors beyond their borders, not knowing of their protectors.

Luke's arc would be about realizing that hiding in the dark is not the right way. By cutting themselves off, the Jedi would not be able to work together with the New Republic or their non-Jedi friends, making them all weaker. And by being secret, they would not be able to be a beacon of hope.

A major plot of this version of the sequel trilogy would be gathering Luke's new Jedi from their secret and far-flung missions across the galaxy for the final confrontation againt the First Order.

Oh, and the first secret Jedi he trained would stay on the island with him and be there when he meets Rey. They would actually be a former Imperial sent to kill him, but ended up joining him instead.

Rogue one, Mandalorian S1, Fallen order, and clone wars finale I loved, and solo I pretty decently liked. I’m also beyond hyped for s2 of mandalorian especially after watching the trailer. However, something I saw in the comments of the trailer has me nervous that Disney is still on board with keeping the ST solidly canon. 

In the trailer mando (din whatever) and the child clearly end up on ilum, the planet where Jedi get their kyber crystals. The comments said the same thing, but a lot of them mentioned how Disney retconned starkiller base as being made from ilum in TROS visual book. This makes sense only through the skewed Disney logic even though in TFA starkiller looked nothing like ilum. I mean there were trees and shit on it when ilum is all ice caves, and starkiller used like a sun or some bullshit to power or not kyber crystals. It makes me think that Disney is gonna use content like the mandalorian in a similar to the clone wars show. 

Clone wars really adds to the canon of the Star Wars prequels, and I think was pretty significant in the awareness of love for the prequels. I think Disney is aware of this, and they’re gonna use this strategy to stuff as much ST retcon as they can in the mandalorian to try and make the sequels seem more appealing. It would mean that Disney is full sending it on the retcon strategy instead of chocking the entire ST up as a loss. I guess we’ll see what Filoni and favrue do... Lmk what you guys think about my conspiracy theory.

Edit: so a lot of this thinking came to head when I saw ilum in fallen order.

Under Lucas's watchful eye, Star Wars managed to get such fantastic and remarkable toy and merchandise sales by being creative. Making new vehicles, new aliens, new weapons, new planets, new characters, all that can be made into merch to attract kids and collectors alike, while cleverly expanding the universe at the same time. Even the amount of video games was larger, the gameplay was more diverse (shooters like Battlefront, RPGs like KOTOR, strategy games such as Empire at War, even flight simulators like TIE Fighter), and captivated every audience. Basically, printing money through creativity and innovation.
The Kennedy regime, however, simply decides to repaint and resize the same merchandise you bought before and sell it again (red stormtroopers, blue A-Wings, black TIE Fighters, bigger AT-ATs, bigger Star Destroyers) to try and make money, without knowing that people probably won't buy the same thing twice. Then there's their stranger attempts at making money like putting the SW name on soup, bananas, toasters, and trash cans (likely to dispose of copies of TLJ), all that seriously lack the creativity that came out of the Lucas era.
If they really wanted the best setup to make money, they would end the Galactic Civil War at a later date to allow for media featuring the New Republic battling the Imperial Remnant, with each warlord having their own troopers and ships to have toys made out of, launch a multimedia prelude to TFA showing Luke's New Jedi Order including a TV series, books and comics, and video games, give the Republic/Resistance and First Order new types of armor and ships, and launch a series of animated adaptations of Legends stories for the hardcore audience.

But there is an important difference though. I think a ""true fan"" (don't even know what this means anymore anyway) knows how to be critic about the new entries of a beloved saga, without the need of nostalgia. It's a common mistake to think that a true SW fan has to love everything that has the name on it. Blind love is as dangerous as blind hate. So it's not that we took the hate only to return it with the sequels, it's only a matter of how it's made and how it makes sense or not.

I really think we've evolved in that matter. It doesn't have to be payback. Many people that shit on the sequels also didn't like the prequels, for example. So what happens if I do love Star Wars but really despise the sequels? Am I a lesser fan, or a nostalgic hater with revenge thirst?

If only, the hate on the prequels has made the fandom stronger. We acknowledge what's wrong and enjoy them anyway. I've really tried liking the sequels, but knowing their conception as a whole makes me sad, as I now officially know thanks to Daisy Ridley that they had no plan and discarded any of OG Lucas input.

The most important thing of a new entry of a beloved saga is the respect for the source material and the people who grew up with it. It's funny to see how the prequels were hated for not being like the originals, and now the sequels are hated for trying to be too much like the originals (amongst many other things, of course).

I can dislike JarJar or some dialogues or whatever from the prequels, but they expanded and connected with everything, are cohesive to the overall story and created many possibilities inside the lore. It's the opposite with the sequels, and I don't even have to write an essay to explain it. You guys are comprehensive about this, but outside there's a lot of sequel lover that doesn't get into the lore an will go like ""uuuh you just hater because reasons"".

She has seen the OT (okay I forced her to watch it) and I was trying to explain to her what are the prequels and the sequels.


For the prequels, the words came easy to me: ""They're the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker, and the story of the fall of the Republic, which turns into the Empire.""

But when I tried to explain what are the sequels, I realised I couldn't succinctly say what is the story: ""They're the story of - well, the Empire wasn't really destroyed it seems, and the Rebels are still Rebels. For the characters it's the story of... Actually I don't know there are a lot of characters and some of them don't change at all throughout the 3 movies and some of them kind of just disappear partway through the trilogy... *silence* ...I don't really know what it's the story of.""


While the prequels are definitely not always beautiful-written, their overall story arc is so clear and enjoyable. It's obvious George set out and knew what story he wanted to tell from the beginning, and he accomplished it. For the sequels, it's so clear that nobody knew what story they wanted to tell, up until the very last scene of the last movie, even.

What do you think is the most likely reason why the movie makers made it so?

* The movie makers had Rey be sent to get Luke because simply because she was the protagonist and they straight up forgot that Rey had no established connection to Leia, Luke and the Resistance.

* That it was a leftover for one of George’s original draft that was about a female protagonist named Kira going on a personal quest to find Luke and she was suppose to find him midday throug the movie but then it was decided to have Luke’s discovery be delayed until the end because they feared he would overshadow the new characters so they rewrote the story so they could have the protagonist find him at the end of the movie instead but they never realized that in this new story they created it makes absolutely no sense for Rey to be the one to find Luke because in the original story by George Kira wasn’t sent by anyone.

You could skip from the 25 minute mark when the Falcon leaves Ajan Kloss to the last 30 minutes starting from when Rey steals Kylo’s TIE and it changes nothing. This comes from the redundancy of the macguffin quest, as the quest for the Emperor’s wayfinder and the Sith dagger ultimately become pointless once Rey steals a separate wayfinder. And not only that but there are even parts of that redundancy that are redundant. The whole contrivance about 3PO being unable to read the dagger and the capture of Chewie and the Dagger land the heroes right back to where they were 20 minutes earlier when all is said and done.

It’s not just the macguffin quest being pointless either, it’s the lack of any development to the story and characters. Take a movie like *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* where the quest for the holy grail results in its loss, but it doesn’t feel like that because all of the characters learned something and grew- Indiana and his father made piece with one another in the end. But what growth happens in TROS? Poe and Finn are sidekicks, Kylo’s redemption could’ve happened at any point in the narrative, and Rey learning that she’s a Palpatine mattered for one scene on Ahch-To.

You could honestly rewrite the plot so when Rey and Kylo fight over the transport on Pasaana, Kylo relieves her lineage and then they fight before she steals his TIE. The Resistance escapes back to the base and with Lando they gather allies while Rey ponders about her future and trains with Luke.

I do not hate the sequels quite as much as most people here probably do. I just find them disappointing. I kinda liked The Force Awakens, but I hoped the other two would be better and not much worse. 

Star Wars is such a rich and great franchise that I wish, I could have created a story in that universe. I love the themes and I even love the prequels. Lightsabers are the coolest invention ever.

I never thought much about the sequels, but I talked a bit with friends about it and it just makes me sad. Like really sad, especially when I see how many fans are sad, how  many actors are angry and mostly how much potential was wasted. 

I mean, why do that? They had awesome effects and cinematography were great. Actors did their best, Mark Hamill was awesome as old Luke. I loved Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley probably saved Rey from being even more boring. I wish they could have been part of a better trilogy. I once met Daisy and I know a dude who has met her a few times and she seems really sad and like she has lost a lot of her energy. Mark Hamill wanted to play Luke again and they destroyed him. I think you're better off being a poor man somewhere than to see a character you love destroyed so bad.

I know, I bring nothing new to the table, but it is just so sad. With the whole situation right now, I have a lot of time to think and it makes me feel sad and sick how much they butchered a great opportunity. 

Even if they didn't care about the story, they could have at least made fun movies. I'm a casual fan and I will never see all the nuances but I know it was the wrong story. Something simple like Rey is Lukes student, Kylo her best friend and he turns to the dark side with Snoke being a creepy and powerful new Force User would have been not the best or the deepest story, but at least fun. 

Seriously, I wish it was just a simple story of Luke and his student Rey (and later Finn after his escape) fighting against some new Dark side users with many great shots, fights and character moments. I know that would not have been the best either, but a lot more fun. 

Being predictable can be better than subverting expectations the wrong way.

But no matter how cool it looks I can't help but feel constantly reminded how in new canon the war against the Empire ends after just one year following Endor. Jakku has to be where almost all major fighting comes to an end. No warlords period, nothing like the old Rogue Squadron books, no grand sandbox for future writers video games and creators to play around with. Nothing. Straight to the era where our heroes are working hard to be failures and deadbeats. Where the New Republic will make the League of Nations seem competent. Where so far the only thing at all interesting is a small story about a baby and a bounty hunter.

This all baffles me. Disney Star Wars seems to want to cut itself off at the knees when it could create a setting that prints money. Take for example completely killing off the Jedi(again), Disney could have created something more akin to Jedi Hogwarts, with new characters and houses and all that sort of stuff that I and so many others would have eaten open. Instead they choose to go down the creative and financial dead end of killing off the Jedi again. It doesn't even make sense in the context of stuff like the Disney Parks where you can build your own lightsaber. That fits nowhere in the Sequels. Heck Rey doesn't even do that until the final minute of the last film. 

So the same goes with the galactic Civil War. Rebels vs Empire is the most iconic thing outside of Jedi in Star Wars. It's so iconic that JJ basically just copy pasted it with the Resistance and the First Order. But why kill this cash cow? As we've seen with both Squadrons and Rogue One people love this stuff. And unlike the death of the Jedi there was nothing in TFA to make this so. For all it's faults TFA is at least so vague in it's world building that it leaves the previous 30 years wide open, especially on a macro galactic focus. I just cant believe that given that wide open 30 years to milk Star Wars no executive stepped in when the likes of Chuck Wendig and the Story Group decided to just end the whole thing. I guess it just reinforces how nobody was in charge and had any idea the value of the intellectual property they just bought. Or perhaps they so wanted to make Star Wars theirs they forced it to end so we could transition immediately to their knock off Empire, and copycat Storm Troopers, and bootleg rebellion. I think thats what makes Jon Favreau look so good with the Mandalorian, he at least knows the value of the Star Wars Nostalgia and intellectual property. 

So yeah just a mini rant about how Disney squandered what should have been a money printing machine. Star Wars fans don't hate Star Wars, we are some of the easiest marks in the business.  It really just shows how badly they handled it that there was this type of pushback. 
My one hope is that perhaps now that competent creative types seem to be taking over at least on the TV side we might get some type of Retcon. Sadly I don't think we will see the Sequels decanonized anytime soon,  but if the half assed stuff put out in the first few years of the new canon eu could be undone there would at least be a new playground for me to play with my Star Wars toys in. Because in all honesty do you really think that if Jon Favreau wants to do something to make a bunch of money someone is going to tell him ""oh sorry sir we can't do that, that would conflict with Chuck Wendig's Aftermath series or some book about the Alphabet!""",saltierthancrait,"the squadrons short really reinforces just how bad the decision to end the war in one year was from a creative perspective i loved the squadrons short it and the game itself are giving me flashbacks to 90s golden era of xwings vs ties 
but no matter how cool it looks i cant help but feel constantly reminded how in new canon the war against the empire ends after just one year following endor jakku has to be where almost all major fighting comes to an end no warlords period nothing like the old rogue squadron books no grand sandbox for future writers video games and creators to play around with nothing straight to the era where our heroes are working hard to be failures and deadbeats where the new republic will make the league of nations seem competent where so far the only thing at all interesting is a small story about a baby and a bounty hunter all baffles me disney star wars seems to want to cut itself off at the knees when it could create a setting that prints money take for example completely killing off the jediagain disney could have created something more akin to jedi hogwarts with new characters and houses and all that sort of stuff that i and so many others would have eaten open instead they choose to go down the creative and financial dead end of killing off the jedi again it doesnt even make sense in the context of stuff like the disney parks where you can build your own lightsaber that fits nowhere in the sequels heck rey doesnt even do that until the final minute of the last film  the same goes with the galactic civil war rebels vs empire is the most iconic thing outside of jedi in star wars its so iconic that jj basically just copy pasted it with the resistance and the first order but why kill this cash cow as weve seen with both squadrons and rogue one people love this stuff and unlike the death of the jedi there was nothing in tfa to make this so for all its faults tfa is at least so vague in its world building that it leaves the previous 30 years wide open especially on a macro galactic focus i just cant believe that given that wide open 30 years to milk star wars no executive stepped in when the likes of chuck wendig and the story group decided to just end the whole thing i guess it just reinforces how nobody was in charge and had any idea the value of the intellectual property they just bought or perhaps they so wanted to make star wars theirs they forced it to end so we could transition immediately to their knock off empire and copycat storm troopers and bootleg rebellion i think thats what makes jon favreau look so good with the mandalorian he at least knows the value of the star wars nostalgia and intellectual property  yeah just a mini rant about how disney squandered what should have been a money printing machine star wars fans dont hate star wars we are some of the easiest marks in the business  it really just shows how badly they handled it that there was this type of pushback 
my one hope is that perhaps now that competent creative types seem to be taking over at least on the tv side we might get some type of retcon sadly i dont think we will see the sequels decanonized anytime soon  but if the half assed stuff put out in the first few years of the new canon eu could be undone there would at least be a new playground for me to play with my star wars toys in because in all honesty do you really think that if jon favreau wants to do something to make a bunch of money someone is going to tell him oh sorry sir we cant do that that would conflict with chuck wendigs aftermath series or some book about the alphabet",1,3674,685,1,0.172,0.709,0.118,-0.9945

When the prequels came out, another generation grew up with and loved them. The OT-geners, many of them shocked that someone could even like the prequels, started harshly battering the prequels community for the better part of ten years. Today, the prequels have an established, though still not fully accepted, community. Now, there is an emerging generation of sequels kids, who have started a small community against which the prequels fanbase is weaponizing all it's pain from being subject to hatred for years into hatred of their own. 

The common prediction is that the cycle will repeat and the sequels will survive and get a loving generation of their own, eventually completing the cycle with the sequelers' abuse for the next trilogy.

But I deeply dread this happening. The sequels are genuinely bad movies; they don't deserve the love of a generation. When you see how insufferable the writing is and how manufactured their whole plan was, it would be painful to see a generation grow up on this, thinking that they're some of the best movies of all time, not even considering that they're bad because any complaints are immediately shelved as racist or sexist, and loving them primarily because they came out at a certain time.

But for many of the same reasons why they're so bad, the sequels might not get this great treatment. The sequels are different than the prequels and the originals. They don't exist because George Lucas wanted to make them. They exist because of Disney's greed, and that has to affect something. And it may.

 The next trilogy starts in 2023, which doesn't give the sequel fans a lot of time to build their fanbase and grow up with their movies before something new comes in to replace it and them. By a similar token, if these movies were manufactured money-grabs, what will stop the next big piece of pop garbage from replacing the sequels, leaving the sequels kids to soon forget them? Maybe Disney will realize its mistakes and get some writers who can actually write to plan the sequels, and the DT fans will realize how much the sequels were worse before they get deeply-rooted enough, at very least, this trilogy-bunching could stop the generational divide or give the sequels kids the high ground over the fans of the trilogy after the next, ending or lessening the tradition of abuse in the Star Wars community.

637,All the Sith > All the Jedi,26,isinr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/isinr2/all_the_sith_all_the_jedi/,4,1600109665.0,"The Sith are more powerful than the Jedi in terms of combat. Proof:

Number of times Jedi were defeated by Sith in the full saga (Episodes I-VI): 10 (Qui Gonn vs Maul, Dooku vs Anakin, Dooku vs Obi Wan, Dooku vs Obi Wan (III), Palpatine vs Windu (Palpatine throws the fight to look weak in front of Anakin but Palpatine still kills Windu So I’m counting it for Palps), Palpatine vs the two Jedi, Obi Wan vs Vader, Luke vs Vader, Palpatine vs Luke)

Number of times Sith were defeated by Jedi: 4 (Obi Wan defeats Maul, Obi Wan defeats Anakin/Vader, Anakin defeats Dooku, Luke defeats Vader)

And in 2/4 cases (Anakin and Luke) they won the duel specifically by tapping into the Dark Side and this is portrayed as a bad thing. So if we were being REALLY pedantic, we could say that only the two Obi Wan duels actually counted as a Jedi truly ‘winning’ the battle without the dark side.  

When Yoda says the Dark aside is not stronger, he means that it is overall not stronger than the light, because the light side excels at other things. For example, light spiders live much longer than Sith as the force keeps their bodies alive. Jedi can also save themselves after death but Sith cannot (I know RoS took a great big crap on this idea with Palpatine surviving but we’re currently only talking about Canon Star Wars here so it doesn’t count).

So in terms of pure combat ability, All The Sith would easily triumph over All the Jedi, because the Sith rely on combat and violence far more. Hence, Rey Palpatine would have turned into a smoking pile of ash (which to be fair she would have done anyway considering you can’t deflect a lightning storm capable of taking out every Rebel spaceship with a pair of glowing plasma sticks). 

PS: This is why I was so disgusted by Kylo vs Rey in TFA. The dark side is meant to be FAR more powerful in combat than the light, and Rey should have stood no chance whatsoever. The fact that the film thinks overcoming evil is as simple as “closing your eyes then beating them up” is really insulting to the intelligence of the audience imo.",saltierthancrait,all the sith  all the jedi the sith are more powerful than the jedi in terms of combat proof of times jedi were defeated by sith in the full saga episodes ivi 10 qui gonn vs maul dooku vs anakin dooku vs obi wan dooku vs obi wan iii palpatine vs windu palpatine throws the fight to look weak in front of anakin but palpatine still kills windu so i’m counting it for palps palpatine vs the two jedi obi wan vs vader luke vs vader palpatine vs luke of times sith were defeated by jedi 4 obi wan defeats maul obi wan defeats anakinvader anakin defeats dooku luke defeats vader in 24 cases anakin and luke they won the duel specifically by tapping into the dark side and this is portrayed as a bad thing so if we were being really pedantic we could say that only the two obi wan duels actually counted as a jedi truly ‘winning’ the battle without the dark side   yoda says the dark aside is not stronger he means that it is overall not stronger than the light because the light side excels at other things for example light spiders live much longer than sith as the force keeps their bodies alive jedi can also save themselves after death but sith cannot i know ros took a great big crap on this idea with palpatine surviving but we’re currently only talking about canon star wars here so it doesn’t count in terms of pure combat ability all the sith would easily triumph over all the jedi because the sith rely on combat and violence far more hence rey palpatine would have turned into a smoking pile of ash which to be fair she would have done anyway considering you can’t deflect a lightning storm capable of taking out every rebel spaceship with a pair of glowing plasma sticks  this is why i was so disgusted by kylo vs rey in tfa the dark side is meant to be far more powerful in combat than the light and rey should have stood no chance whatsoever the fact that the film thinks overcoming evil is as simple as “closing your eyes then beating them up” is really insulting to the intelligence of the audience imo,1,2102,387,1,0.196,0.678,0.126,-0.9885

647,Question: Does anyone here knows of any positive reviews of The Force Awakens that was made shortly after that movie’s premiere that actually praises the PLOT of that movie?,32,isd4cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/isd4cn/question_does_anyone_here_knows_of_any_positive/,8,1600082979.0,"Seriously looking back at all the positive reviews of people completely fawning over that movie I couldn’t help but notice that almost all positive reviews of the movie boiled down to the following:

* “It was so cool to see (insert something OT again!”

* It’s better then the Prequels!”

* “(Insert any under explained plot point) is totally going to be explained in the Sequels!”

* “Practical sets!”

But none of them seems to actually praise the actual plot of the movie probably because there isn’t that much to praise at all. It is a blatant ANH ripoff that copies WHAT happened in TFA but not HOW and WHY they happen which results in many plots points in that movie happening only because of massive coincidences.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park has a writing rule when making stories and that is that when you make an outline for your story you should make sure to not write “and then” in between each story beats and instead write “therefor” or “but” and that rules is so fitting for describing why the plot of TFA is so poor despite coping ANH:

Rey meets BB-8 that has a map to Luke Skywalker and then it turns out that that Luke’s brother-in-law’s ship happen to be on the same place she happened to live and then she meets Han who just happen to be close enough to detect and track down the Falcon and then Han takes her to a place that happens to have Luke’s old lightsaber and then she is kidnapped and then she she happens to master the force instantly right away then she happens to run into Han, Chewie and Finn aboard SKB a Base that its the SIZE OF A PLANET and then she beats Kylo and then the planets splits open so that he can live for the sequels and then Rey meets and is hugged by Leia and then is sent to retrieve Luke even though she is a complete stranger to both of them.

Any positive reviews of TFA when discussing the plot of the movie seems way more preoccupied with trying to rationalize it instead of praising it and the most common rationalization I kept hearing was of course the old “anything questionable about TFA is going to be explained or dealt with in a satisfying way in the sequels”.

Why not cultivate it with direct-to-streaming movies, picking the best stories from Legends and adapting them to animation? The House of Mouse is one of the most famous sources of animation on the planet, so they should be able to do it right.
It would introduce new fans to the Legends universe in a more accessible format plus bring old fans back into the fray by offering a return to their favorite characters.
And don't worry about confusion: you could put a ""A Star Wars Legend"" subtitle, or a Legends banner, or a content warning that this tells a different story than the DT and should not be mistaken for it. 
You could start with a two-part adaptation of Knights of the Old Republic as a test run to see whether or not it will sell with fans, and continue with the brand if it ends up successful. 
We could even start a shared post-Endor universe going through the Thrawn Trilogy, an X-Wing TV series, the Jedi Academy Trilogy, the Hand of Thrawn, a TV miniseries based on Young Jedi Knights, and finally ending it with a TV adaptation of the New Jedi Order saga.
And who knows? If it's popular, they could go backwards and adapt the Han Solo trilogy, Death Troopers, Shadows of the Empire, Darth Plagueis, Shatterpoint, and other pre-Endor novels. 
As a whole, direct-to-streaming Legends adaptations could be extremely successful and give the Mouse everything they want: good reception, fans flocking to their side, tons of streaming content and subscribers to watch them, and best of all - money and merch!

And while this does sound cool in theory, and would definitely still be better than what we got, how would this make any sense?

The entire movie was about trying to find and complete the map to Luke Skywalker. So wouldn't the map be rendered pointless if Luke suddenly showed up?

And we know from TLJ that Luke didn't want to leave the island. So why would he go to Starkiller Base?

But okay. Let's ignore TLJ and assume that Luke DID want to leave the island. What would cause him to show up at that very moment?

696,Let's discuss ThEmEs: 'Restoration' in RotJ.,28,irhhc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/irhhc6/lets_discuss_themes_restoration_in_rotj/,3,1599962784.0,"Perhaps the biggest flaw of the reboot trilogy is that it undoes the ending of RotJ.

Undoing an ending might not seem like a big deal in most cases, but for RotJ it runs directly counter to the very core of the culminating theme.

So let's define this term clearly. What is 'Restoration' as opposed to 'the good guys win!' or simple victory?

A restoration indicates a fall from grace or a collapsed dynasty. Star Wars builds off the idea that not only are good guys fighting bad guys, but that a long period of goodness was ended by a tragic evil. The story we are about to witness is about putting history back on track to resume the positive human experience of peaceful stability..

So some special elements of a restoration become clear: 

--It is inherently humanistic and positive. The great course of history is peace and justice and the restoration is ending a temporary blip where that natural progress was disrupted by an aberration in the system. And humans have the power to chart their own destiny.

--The aberration was a tragic fall. The fall is a one-time deal where an exceptional and unlikely convergence of factors led to the solid stability of a good system overloading. Examples would be King John taking over England in Robin Hood after Richard is captured or The line of kings being broken in Gondor because of the poison of Sauron's ring.

--The tragic fall will be reversed in the Restoration. Which implies that a restoration is a one-time deal as well. Once the heroes have ended the evil, the system of goodness returns to normal functioning. We expect peace and stability to be the long term result of a restoration.

So where is Restoration in RotJ?

Everywhere, start to finish, in little things and in overarching large things.

Han Solo begins the movie in carbonite and is restored to his friends and his lover. This is a small one, but I think it's one of the most crowd-pleasing ones. We all want to hug Han like that ewok does. We know he's been through a lot. He started out a cynical gangster and is now a sincere freedom fighter. He showed this in Empire Strikes Back when he was a key part of setting up Echo Base and a respected leader but then Jabba and Vader ripped him away just as he was beginning to look like he would be part of the long term goodness of the Rebellion. When he is restored to Leia and Luke, he takes the rank of General and gets to work planning operations. He is clearly positioned to take a long term role in the stable and beneficial functioning of the Rebellion once it is restored to power.

We meet Mon Mothma in RotJ. This is our first glimpse of a political structure above the Rebellion (previous leadership shown to the audience was General Dadonna, a military commander.). And it is quite deliberate because her scene takes place on the cusp of the restoration of the Republic. The movie is establishing that there is a political class to take up the role of stable and beneficial long-term government once the restoration happens. We see this in Mon Mothma's demeanor. She is mature and even-tempered. She doesn't give a fiery inspirational speech or angry words of revenge. This is not simply a war time leader, but a woman out to establish systemic goodness. 

(I want to cut away here to mention that at the end of ESB, Vader offers to Luke a chance to 'restore' order to the galaxy. Mon Mothma is shown almost immediately after in the new movie and stands in direct opposition to Vader's style of governance to show us the face of true restoration)

Luke Skywalker begins RotJ calling himself a Jedi Knight. And by the end of the movie, he is. But it's important that he makes the claim early on and that he and Yoda talk about what it will take before he is really a Jedi. Yoda makes clear to Luke that he is to pass on what he has learned.

Yoda and Ben are not simply looking for a win. They are looking to establish something for the future, something that will be like the old days when there were guardians of peace in the Galaxy and so there will be peace for another thousand generations once Luke has restored the Jedi Order.

And then we come to the most thrilling restoration of all. The restoration of Anakin Skywalker's soul. Quite literally, we see that by the end of the movie his spirit is taking on a long term rest. He is part of the light forever now. No one expects that Anakin will have another fall into the Dark Side after RotJ. The tone and presentation of his scene with Luke and Ben and Yoda is pushing the idea of a permanent switch back to goodness.

It's important to note that RotJ makes sure to have Ben tell us clearly in the beginning that Anakin was a good man. This is not accidental. The movie is establishing that Anakin was part of the system of goodness before the aberration attacked the system. Once Anakin stops being Darth Vader, that is symbolic of the whole system coming back on line. Not just a win, but a restoration.

We could talk about other restorations like Luke and Leia being restored to each other as family and the restoration of Ewok self-rule as a microcosm of the galaxy's restoration to freedom or the restoration of balance to the Force as mentioned in the prequels. But I think we get the picture.

Well, okay, what if RotJ is all about that Restoration? So what? 

The reason I make a big deal out of it is because RotJ stands as one of the most satisfying endings of all cinema. Even with the structural and other issues with that movie, almost everyone gets to the end and feels catharsis and satisfaction. 

Humans crave long term stability and we have this internal myth that it is achievable. We tell each other folk tales of lost Camelots when we had long term stability. We tell these tales to inspire us to keep trying to achieve it again via some restoration. Any look at human history will tell you that we are doomed to eternal conflict and recurring wars. But we inspire ourselves with the idea of restoration so we keep working for good. Without that idea of restoration or Paradise or Nirvana to work towards we are left with a darkness of futility.

So that brings us to the tragedy of Disney's reboot. Because everything done by Disney is an attempt to deny the Return of the Jedi and the restoration of the Republic.

I think these things are self evident: Luke has not established a new Jedi order and the Republic lasts a mere 30 years. 

Some shallow analysts might say, 'Hey, the new Jedi and the new Republic lasted 30 years. That was a good run. You expect peace forever?'

That is a failure to comprehend what a restoration is. A restoration is not simply the good guys being on top, but a return to a system of order and stability. A thirty year rule after a thousand years of peace is not a return to stability. So to end the Jedi and Republic after such a historically short time is to cancel the restoration.

And when you dismantle the idea of restoration you destroy the meaning and satisfaction of the ending of RotJ. What once was the final step in a restoration now becomes one more step in an endless struggle to defeat a cyclic evil.

And there are fans of Disney's reboot who will say that exactly: Evil is cyclic, so it makes sense that it will rise again.

But the whole point of Restoration is that it is mythic, not sensible! 

Star Wars is a fairy tale. It became the greatest American story because of the power of it's unlikely restoration story. Humans have an inherent understanding that Restoration is not possible so we take solace in the tales that give that to us.

We can see the endless cycle of evil all around us in real life:  wars, abusive families, bullies at school, racism taking new forms, religious strife...

The power of Star Wars (RotJ especially) was the escapism. It has literally been called a great modern myth, uplifting us all.

But Disney dragged us all down from the dream we were having in the clouds and shoved our face in the pools of shit lying all around us in 'realistic' cinema with its creation of a universe of unending strife. It takes away the humanistic outlook and replaces it with fatalism. Humans can't make meaningful change, Disney tells us. Outside forces will always make our dreams absurd and futile. 

What SHOULD happen to a story after a Restoration, though? We can't have a story or a sequel without conflict. And it can't be a small conflict after the original story is epic in scale.

Correct.

But a restoration is not eternal peace A restoration is when we put back a system for addressing evil. The Jedi and the Republic were the system that worked. Ben Kenobi never said the Jedi sat around for a thousand generations because there was no evil. He said they were guardians of peace. That means that there was evil to fight against even in the golden age. And there is evil to fight against AFTER a restoration as well.

What is different after a restoration is the system in play. Are cop movies boring and conflict-free because the cops have the whole government on their side? Judges and warrants and the good will of society all work to help our cop heroes find the bank robbers or terrorists etc.

The funny part is that the conflict for Episodes 7-9 was the easiest thing to plot out. Episodes 1-3 were about how the aberration destroyed the system. Episodes 4-6 were about how the system was restored by those who learned from the mistakes of the past. Episodes 7-9 simply had to show the restored system repelling a second attempt to destroy it because it is now a better system. 

Chaos and evil are still abroad in the Galaxy Far Far Away 30 years after RotJ. We have Hutts for instance (whose evil was shown extensively in the previous movies). We have the Empire's remains. We have general criminal chaos. You would have to be incompetent not to be able to take just those established elements and not make a compelling three-movie arc out of them. And that's before the fact that you could make up anything to throw in their on your own! How about a breakaway faction of the Republic that believes in retribution against planets who supported the Empire? Ooooh, juicy. Right away we come face to face with the theme of how to apply justice without falling into militarism. Seems familiar...

What about Luke trying to teach? What kind of teacher is he? What happens if he is surpassed by a star pupil named Rey? Does she feel he has nothing more to show her and go off on her own, only to face corruption? Does he feel jealousy of her skills and withdraw because of the darkness he sees in his envy?

Oooh, more juicy stuff.

699,Disney Star Wars’ biggest failing: The Disney Trilogy is a Cargo Cult,103,irfbsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/irfbsy/disney_star_wars_biggest_failing_the_disney/,17,1599955758.0,"First, some background. When Western soldiers first arrived in Melanesia (around New Guinea) during the Second World War, they brought advanced technology the people there had never seen there, such as aeroplanes and wallow talkies, which the western soldiers would speak into to get supplies.

The Western Soldiers left, but the impact that they left on the natives did not leave. The natives began making their own “walkie talkies” out of wood and speaking into them, believing that this ritual would allow them to summon aeroplanes which would deliver them supplies. They even went as far as to make space for entire pseudo-runways for the planes to land on. 

The point here is that they only understood these things on a superficial level; they knew about the imagery but they didn’t understand the point. 

This is exactly analogous to Disney Star Wars, JJ Abrams in particular. TakeThe Death Star in IV acted as the thing which drives the entire plot; the whole story is about delivering the plans to destroy the Death Star. These plans are placed into the droids right at the start of the story.

In TFA, Starkiller base does not fulfil this role. At first it looks like the Map to a Luke will drive the plot, but that quickly becomes sidelined by Starkiller Base, which is blown up because a janitor happened to know it’s fatal weakness. The plot of delivering the map is literally thrown in the garbage halfway through the story, replaced by SK base, and then SK base is exploded and forgotten about and the plot quickly picks up the discarded threads of the map to Luke. It’s utterly shitty storytelling, and the reason is obvious; JJ shoves SK base in because he wanted to make something that “quintessentially felt like Star Wars” (Iger’s words), so he put in the idea of a planet destroyer without understanding the POINT of the planet destroyed in IV. This is exactly analogous to a cargo cult; copying the imagery to evoke a feeling without being able to understand what the point of that thing original was.

701,META: This sub needs to get over the idea that criticizing JJ or RJ excuses the other.,92,ire11a,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ire11a/meta_this_sub_needs_to_get_over_the_idea_that/,26,1599951388.0,"This has become an issue since RoS came out I think. 

Initially we all got here because of TLJ being such a colossal spit in our faces. We're called 'saltierthancrait' for a reason.

But myself and a few others were saying from the get go that TLJ didn't suddenly turn a good series bad and that it was bad from TFA.

Since RoS, Lots of TLJ fans have become salty and even joined us.

So now we have three schools of criticism:

Those new miners who think things were fine until the end of TLJ.

Those original miners who think that things were fine until the end of TFA.

Those few of us outsiders who think it was always crap and who have won over a fair number of people to our view in recent times.

The problem I see is that some people have the idea that if you attack RoS or TFA you are excusing RJ for his subverting expectations contrarian shitmongering and others who seem to think that if you attack Johnson for his nonsense, you are excusing JJ for his mystery box reboot hackjob.

But pointing out the faults of one or the other doesn't excuse or redeem the other! And attacking JJ isn't trying to excuse Johnson or vice versa unless someone literally and explicitly tries to make that point (and I've never seen that done on STC. Other subs, but not STC)

I think we need to take a step back. We can pick a side, sure, and torpedo our chosen targets all we want. If you think one or the other writer is more responsible for ruining the reboot trilogy, then fire away at them and make your case. But don't make it out to be some conspiracy that critics of one writer are trying to rehab the image of the other.

The sad part about what was done to Star Wars by Disney is that we have multiple villains among the executives and 'creatives'. There is more than enough scope to point out the different flavors of callous cruelty of these villains in their various roles.

ADDENDUM: Copied this from a comment I made on another thread:

>JJ Abrams set the airplane on a dive to the ground then jumped out of the door with a parachute.

>Johnson had a chance to pull up. Instead he put the plane into an uncontrolled spin towards a cliff while laughing maniacally.

I am finding it hard to explain what I mean but there seems to be something very strange with how its shot. He never seems to be in the same shot with other actors. It always like this

· Close up of Rey delivering lines that never openly acknowledge Sidious……so she could be talking to any villain really. She never refers to him as grandfather or anything

· Switches back to a close up of palpatine sometimes with the back of Reys head slightly out of frame

· Wide shots of Rey but with Palpatine shown from behind or from the side…… so his face is never seen

**·** Some scenes focus on Rey with his dialogue in the background so was that added in after? I think they call it ADR 

So if those rumors that Matt smith was originally meant to be the main villain………did he perhaps shoot those scenes with Daisy and then later they brought Ian in  to reshoot them and that’s why you never see them fully in the same shot because its Smith under that cloak and not mcdermid

Because in the OT and prequels you saw him directly with characters but in the ST they seem to almost be trying to conceal him

711,Is JJ Abrams just a fall guy?,63,ir9zml,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ir9zml/is_jj_abrams_just_a_fall_guy/,80,1599933998.0,"I realize that nine out of ten people here are going to respond “NO HE SUCKS HE RUINED STAR WARS” without reading any further but hear me out for a minute. We know that for TLJ, Rian Johnson was allowed to do whatever he wanted; we can hold Kathleen Kennedy, Bob Iger, the Story Group, etc. accountable for signing off on all his terrible ideas, but ultimately Johnson is the sole author of that film and everything in it is there because he wanted it.

With both TFA and TROS, though, we constantly hear about behind-the-scenes struggles for authorship and executive meddling by Kennedy and Iger. I’m not saying JJ is some visionary auteur who would have turned out a couple of great films if the suits had just left him alone, but how many of their most commonly cited issues would have been alleviated if JJ had had as much control over his two movies as Johnson had over TLJ?

Everyone hates the lack of worldbuilding in TFA and the confusing, muddled state of galactic politics. JJ wrote (and filmed?) a scene that was supposed to take place early in the film where Leia discusses the political state of the galaxy with her aide. It was cut for being too boring. Who made that call? 

Why did TFA introduce a planet that looked exactly like Coruscant and was the seat of the galactic government like Coruscant but wasn’t Coruscant? Rumor has it that JJ wanted to have Coruscant in the film but the LFL execs, fearing the shadow of the prequels, wouldn’t let him.

Everyone hates Starkiller Base and the carbon-copy Death Star trench run that destroys it. Another planet-killing superweapon is already derivative, but if you’re going down that road why not do something different with it and keep it around for the whole trilogy? Allegedly JJ didn’t want it in the movie at all but was forced to include another Death Star to complete TFA’s soft reboot of ANH. Whose idea was it to structure the movie like that, anyway? Again, according to rumor, not JJ’s.

Rey beats Kylo in the first movie, how am I supposed to take him seriously as the main villain for the rest of the trilogy? Well, we probably wouldn’t have had to, because Kylo wasn’t the main villain in TFA; Snoke was. Kylo didn’t become the main villain until Johnson had him kill Snoke in TLJ, forcing him into a role he was clearly unsuited for. Once JJ was back in the driver’s seat he immediately introduced a new villain to knock Kylo out of that role.

But that villain was Palpatine! Bringing him back was possibly the single hackiest creative decision in the whole trilogy. Apparently though it wasn’t even JJ’s idea. Sources vary on if the decree came from Kennedy or Iger but apparently someone decided that Palpatine was the only bad guy who could anchor the conclusion of the saga so JJ had to put him in despite fighting against it. Who was Matt Smith supposed to play? How did Palpatine come back to life? Who decided to make Rey his granddaughter. It’s easy to blame JJ for all this since his name gets the “written by” credit but this whole mess reeks of too many cooks all throwing their own ingredients into the stew.

What can we definitively blame JJ for, then? The sloppy scripts? He had the great idea of making one of the heroes an AWOL stormtrooper, but forgot to explore that conflict in any way—Finn goes from being a brainwashed child soldier to one of the good guys like it’s nothing. But JJ and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the script in, like, a few weeks. Michael Arndt worked on it for a year and got nowhere. I forget, was he just unable to come up with any ideas he was satisfied with, or was it Kennedy and/or Iger who didn’t like where he was going with it? Either way, when you’re forced to come up with the whole story for one of the biggest movies of all time under that kind of pressure, some things are going to fall through the cracks. We know that JJ wanted the release date pushed back and Iger refused; under those circumstances I’m not sure what else we can expect him to have done, besides just not taking the job. In which case it would be some other schmuck getting raked over the coals after having even less time to get the movie ready.

Speaking of Finn, note how JJ made his relationship with Rey the heart of the first film, and then LFL marketing minimized his presence in foreign markets, allowed Johnson to throw his character under the bus in TLJ, and apparently meddled with his storyline in TROS so substantially that it changed John Boyega’s impression of the film and soured him on Star Wars as a whole. If whatever meager vision JJ had for TROS was so heavily impaired in this one way we know about, what else about the movie was changed against his will? Daisy Ridley said that Rey’s heritage was still changing even as they shot the movie. Was that because JJ couldn’t make up his mind, or because he was constantly dealing with new changes mandated by the LFL and Disney executives? It’s unlikely that any film that had to follow the mess left by TLJ could ever be really good, but is it fair to hold JJ accountable for the dumpster fire of TROS if it wasn’t even his dumpster?

So can we at least blame JJ for Luke? Johnson’s the one who pulled the trigger on him, sure, but JJ put him on that island to begin with, so he basically loaded the gun. But Luke being in self-exile after his students were killed comes from George Lucas himself. JJ likely had no idea what Luke was doing in that island but it’s a fair bet it that if he had written Episode VIII it wouldn’t have been what Johnson had him doing in TLJ. JJ wanted Luke levitating boulders at the end of TFA while in Jedi meditation; he was made to change this to accommodate Johnson’s vision of a Luke who had forsaken the Force.

Don’t misunderstand me, I’m not saying JJ deserves no blame for how the trilogy turned out, even if that blame is for twice agreeing to take a job where he had so little creative authority, or that his movies would have somehow been amazing if he’d been allowed to make them without corporate interference. In that situation, it’s likely that people would still have complaints about Rey being overpowered, the Big Three never reuniting on screen, the Empire returning, etc.

Maybe the movies were doomed to suck regardless, but that’s not my point. My point is: is JJ Abrams apportioned a share of the blame significantly greater than he deserves? Yes, he was the writer and director but if Kennedy and Iger interfered as much as rumor has it, the final products aren’t really his movies. Joss Whedon was on top of the world after successfully pulling off the first Avengers movie and he still had Age of Ultron taken away from him and ruined by artless corporate decision-making.

*Disney:*

\-**Kylo Ren**: whiny Emo boy with a backstory that's never explained in the films, and the books and comics apparently contradict each other regarding his background aswell. Also, discount Jacen Solo /Darth Caedus in a shitty Revan cosplay outfit.

\-**Snoke**: apparently just a meaningless meat puppet for Palpy as we learn in the film, but again, books and comics contradict that aswell.

\-**The Knights of Ren**: a biker gang of wannabe cool guys who have nothing to do with anything and never matter in the Story.

\-**Creamy Sheev / Zombie Palpy**: Somehow, he returned.

\-**Captain Phasma**: Nothing Character in shiny armor.

*EU:*

\-**The** **Ssi-ruuk**: a dinosaur-like warrior species that enslaves humans and uses them as batteries for their ships.

\-**Jerec**: a former Jedi archaeologist and now an imperial Inquisitor, Jerec tried finding the ancient Valley of the Jedi on Ruusan, where Lord Kaan (tricked by Darth Bane) used the Thought Bomb to wipe out both the Jedi and the Sith on the planet. He believes this Force Nexus will give him unlimited power.

\-**Cronal** aka **Blackhole** aka **Lord Shadowspawn**: a former Hand of the Emperor and a nihilistic Sorcerer who becomes a warlord with his own faction of black amored Stormtroopers. Cronal tried to make Luke Skywalker the new Emperor who the imperials would follow, and then take over Luke's body instead.

\-**Ysanne Isard**: Director of Imperial Intelligence, Isard, aka ""Iceheart"", is a calculating, ruthless, cold biatch. When she is forced to leave Coruscant to the Rebels, she unleashes the deadly Krytos Virus, which only kills certain alien species, then she takes control of the Galaxy's Bacta supply.

\-**Warlord** **Zsinj**: first imperial warlord, terrorizes both the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant, comes across as both a psychopath and an idiot.

\-**Grand Admiral Thrawn**: tactical genius, Thrawn unites the different imperial factions and almost destroys the New Republic before getting killed by his bodyguard Rukh.

\-**Joruus C'baoth**: Clone of the real and long dead Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth was an insane Dark Jedi,wanting to create a new Jedi Order that rules the galaxy. He tries to get Luke, Leia, and Leia's children, aswell as any other Force user, and is eventually killed by Mara Jade.

\-**The Reborn Emperor**: Palpatine is back in clone bodies. While this also happens in the Disney Trilogy, Palpy in *Dark Empire* is still better written than in TROS. He has new superweapons like the World Devastators and the Galaxy Gun, and he tries to bring Luke to the dark side, but fails again. He runs out of clone bodies, and when trying to take over Leia's youngest son Anakin, he got shot in the back by Han Solo. The Order 66 survivor Jedi Empatojayos Brand then sacrifices himself to trap Palpatine's soul and take him to hell, where all Jedi who ever lived will make sure Palpy never returns.

\-**Exar Kun**: the ghost of an ancient Sith-Lord, influencing Luke's students and make them fall to the dark side. He eventually gets defeated by Luke's first class of students

\-**Admiral Natasi Daala**: while a charismatic leader, she had to climb the imperial ranks by having an affair with Grand Moff Tarkin, as she isn't a good military strategist. She always falls upwards, becoming Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance decades later.

\-**Gilad Pellaon**: the Dr. Watson to Thrawn's Sherlock Holmes, Pellaeon joins forces with Daala and later becomes Grand Admiral and Leader of the imperial Remnant, he's also the one who offers the New Republic a peace treaty, and later becomes friends with Luke Skywalker and the gang.

\-**Hethrir**: one of the Dark Jedi working for the Empire, when the Empire broke apart he created his Empire Reborn faction, which kidnapped young force sensitives to train them. He made a deal with the mysterious being known as Waru, which at the end killed him.

\-**Waru**: a trans-dimensional, gelatinous, cube shaped blob from another dimension with healing powers and the Anti-Force (that's from the acclaimed ""worst Star Wars book ever written"", *The Crystal Star*, and yet it's at least fascinating and funny bad.)

\-**The Disciples of Ragnos**: a Sith cult that worships the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. Luke's Jedi Order kicks their ass.

\-**Viceroy Nil Spaar**: a Yevetha and the leader of the Duskhan League, he (and his whole species) is extremely violent, arrogant and racist, seeing other species as vermin that needs to be killed.

\-**Kueller**: a Dark Jedi, and a drop out of Luke's Jedi Academy, the young and dopy looking Dolph named himself Kueller and started wearing a skeleton-like mask to seem more intimidating (sounds familiar?). He blows up the Senate, killing dozens of Senators. Kueller gets shot by Leia at the end.

\-**Thrackan Sal-Solo**: Han's evil and racist cousin, Thrackan is the head of the Human League, and tried to make the Corellian system independent from the New Republic, using the ancient Corellian Centerpoint Station as a weapon to destroy stars if they refused his demands. He also is responsible for the second Galactic Civil War, and finally got shot by Mirta Gev, Boba Fett and Han Solo repeatedly

\-**Nom Anor**: a executor of the Yuuzhan Vong, Nom Anor was manipulating things from the shadows, leading the way for the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, he infected Mara Jade Skywalker with a deadly virus and continued to follow his own plans during the Yuuzhan Vong War, going against his own people if necessary.

\-**Supreme Overlord Shimrra**: The Leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, Shimrra is a intimidating giant, holding his own in a duel against Luke Skywalker (of course he still loses to him). Shmirra became more and more insane over time, since a twist revealed that in reality his jester Onimi was the real Overlord controlling (and simultaneously destroying) Shimrra's mind with force.

\-**The Killiks**: lead by the Nightsister and member of the One Sith (see below), Lomi Plo, the insectoid hive-minded Killiks started a war against the Galactic Alliance and the Chiss.

\-**Darth Caedus / Jacen Solo**: Han and Leia's son became a Sith Lord in order to save the galaxy from chaos. He was trying not to repeat the mistakes of his grandfather, but still ended up failing.

\-**Abeloth**: the Mother of The Ones, the bringer of Chaos, Abeloth is a Lovecraftian goddess trying to take control over the whole galaxy, aswell as trying to recreate the Family of the Ones, with Luke and Ben Skywalker, aswell as Vestara Khai.

\-**The Lost Tribe of the Sith**: during the times of the Great Hyperspace War a Sith mining Ship, the *Omen*, crashed on an unknown planet, and the surviving Sith build a society that would only be found by the rest of the Galaxy 5000 years later druing Luke's times.

\-**Saes Rrogan**: similar to the Lost Tribe, the Kaleesh Ex-Jedi Rrogen is a Sith on board the sister ship of the *Omen*, the *Harbringer*, which accidently travels 5000 years into the future, but gets destroyed pretty quickly.

\-**Vestara Khai**: a member of the Lost Tribe and the love interest of Ben Sykwalker, Vestara betrays him and the Jedi, aswell as leaving what's left of the Lost Tribe.

\-**Marvid and Craitheus Qreph**: these two highly intelligent Columi were the leaders of a criminal enterprise, and found, what may have been, the Mortis Monolith, trying to gain the ability to use the Force from it.

\-**Darth Krayt**: the former Tusken, Jedi Knight, and Bounty Hunter A'Sharad Hett. After the Order 66 he gets defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine, where he tries to lead the Tusken, so he becomes a Bounty Hunter and eventually gets captured by the Yuuzhan Vong. After he escpaes them, he finds ancient Sith-Holocrons on Korriban, becomes Darth Krayt and creates his own new Sith Order, the One Sith, who follow the Rule of One. Over the decades he secretly builds a big army, and after a hundred years, which he spend mostly in Stasis, he reveals himself to the galaxy and almost destroys the New Jedi Order. He eventually gets killed by Cade Skywalker

\-**The One Sith Order**: Most of the followers were trained from birth and were inculcated with a sense of absolute loyalty to the order, and sported a red-and-black [t](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_tattoo)attooed appearance. Of course we all remember Darth Talon.

**-Darth Wredd**: Forced to become a member of the One Sith Order, he hated and wanted to destroy them. He succeds in driving the One Sith out of hiding after Darth Krayt's death, and they get wiped out in a finale battle on the Floating World. Wredd himself also gets killed by non-Force user Ania Solo and thus, for a while at least, ends the new Sith's presence in the galaxy.",saltierthancrait,a little comparison the eu villains postrotj

718,Why I don’t think Rey’s sudden mastery of The Force in The Force Awakens was ever meant to be a mystery,42,ir588f,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ir588f/why_i_dont_think_reys_sudden_mastery_of_the_force/,6,1599909836.0,"In TFA Rey can suddenly use the Force without any established training. Not only does this contradicts the previous moves were trading was essential in in order to master the Force it even contradicts the movie itself because supposedly the main reason why everyone wants to find Luke is so that he can train new Jedi so having her master the Force right away completely nullifies this goal.

A lot of fans assumed after TFA’s premiere that Rey’s sudden Powers was meant to be a mystery and and explanation for it was planned for the sequel:

Examples:

* She was trained but her memories had been wiped!

* She is a reincarnation of Anakin!

* She is a X-23 like weapon developed by the Empire that implanted Force skills in her 

Etc etc

However I don’t think there was a planned explanation for her Force mastery for this reason:

None of the characters within The Force Awakens treats Rey sudden Force mastery as something unusual.

At best Kylo said that she is strong in the Force but that is not insufficient because Anakin and Luke were also strong in the Force but needed training. Apart from that none of the characters in the movie ever acts like Rey sudden force powers are out of the ordinary.

Kylo never asks her who trained her, Rey doesn’t ask why she can suddenly use the Force etc.

This is a big indication that the writers never intended Rey’s powers to be a mystery because by having none of the characters acknowledge the fact that Rey’s powers goes against established lore that is a big sign that the writers themselves were oblivious to this and have no explanation in mind.

This also extends to other “mysteries” in The Force Awakens:

* Snoke is not a mystery to the characters only to the audience and since they don’t treat him like a mystery that is a big indication that the writers never intended him to be a mystery. He was just the new emperor and that’s it.

* The identity of Rey’s parents were not actually a mystery either. The audience made them a mystery because they hoped that it would provide some explanations for her force powers but within the movie no one asks who her parents were or if there was a connection with them and her force powers.

* Why Luke left isn’t treated as a mystery either. The characters says that he decided to run away from everything and that some SPECULATED that he went looking for the first Jedi temple. The idea that Luke vanished because he want looking for something lost Jedi mcguffin in order to fight Snoke were just theories fans came up with Amin an attempt to justify Luke abandoning his friends and family.",saltierthancrait,why i don’t think rey’s sudden mastery of the force in the force awakens was ever meant to be a mystery in tfa rey can suddenly use the force without any established training not only does this contradicts the previous moves were trading was essential in in order to master the force it even contradicts the movie itself because supposedly the main reason why everyone wants to find luke is so that he can train new jedi so having her master the force right away completely nullifies this goal lot of fans assumed after tfa’s premiere that rey’s sudden powers was meant to be a mystery and and explanation for it was planned for the sequel she was trained but her memories had been wiped she is a reincarnation of anakin she is a x23 like weapon developed by the empire that implanted force skills in her  etc i don’t think there was a planned explanation for her force mastery for this reason of the characters within the force awakens treats rey sudden force mastery as something unusual best kylo said that she is strong in the force but that is not insufficient because anakin and luke were also strong in the force but needed training apart from that none of the characters in the movie ever acts like rey sudden force powers are out of the ordinary never asks her who trained her rey doesn’t ask why she can suddenly use the force etc is a big indication that the writers never intended rey’s powers to be a mystery because by having none of the characters acknowledge the fact that rey’s powers goes against established lore that is a big sign that the writers themselves were oblivious to this and have no explanation in mind also extends to other “mysteries” in the force awakens snoke is not a mystery to the characters only to the audience and since they don’t treat him like a mystery that is a big indication that the writers never intended him to be a mystery he was just the new emperor and that’s it the identity of rey’s parents were not actually a mystery either the audience made them a mystery because they hoped that it would provide some explanations for her force powers but within the movie no one asks who her parents were or if there was a connection with them and her force powers why luke left isn’t treated as a mystery either the characters says that he decided to run away from everything and that some speculated that he went looking for the first jedi temple the idea that luke vanished because he want looking for something lost jedi mcguffin in order to fight snoke were just theories fans came up with amin an attempt to justify luke abandoning his friends and family,1,2698,488,1,0.043,0.879,0.078,0.9658

But I honestly think that this lack of planning wouldn't have mattered or hurt the trilogy so much, if only there had been a consistent creative voice who was involved in mapping out the story of the three films. And of course, if this plan had actually been stuck to.

I've seen the defence of 'well, the Original trilogy wasn't completely planned out from the get go, and they turned out fine'. And that's true - for instance, Leia being Luke's sister wasn't decided until after *Empire* had been finished, and I think even Vader's redemption may have only come onto the table while the story for *Return* was being discussed (though I might be wrong on that last one). **But Lucas was always there.** He was always on hand to ensure that if the story wasn't completely planned out, he at least would have a better chance of making any retcons fit into what had come before. The same should have been done with Episodes VII-IX - some creative voice should have been there from beginning to end, and at least had a say on the story level, if maybe not the screenplay.

What's so frustrating is that [according to Daisy Ridley](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/02/jj-abrams-wrote-drafts-for-star-wars-8-and-9-says-daisy-ridley), this is pretty much exactly what happened with Abrams...

>*J. J. wrote Episode VII, as well as drafts for VIII & IX. Then Rian Johnson arrived and wrote TLJ entirely.* [(source)](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/02/jj-abrams-wrote-drafts-for-star-wars-8-and-9-says-daisy-ridley)

My point is, why **in the hell** was Johnson allowed to scrap these plans?! There should really have been a rule set down by Kennedy and the Lucasfilm/Disney top brass that a plan for the trilogy should be engraved in stone, and that any writer-director coming on would have to follow it. Frankly, if Johnson was unhappy with what Abrams set up and wanted to do his own thing, then Lucasfilm should have replaced him IMO. And I'm saying this as someone who likes TLJ! But I can't deny the way it veers off from what Abrams set up (maybe that's why I like it, come to think of it) and damages the throughline of the trilogy as a whole.

In order to do this, they would have had to show the audeince that these characters have their own personalities while still being worthy successor's to the Original Cast. There are many ways to do this. One way they could have done this is make the nature of the story utterly different, or perhaps even inverted, from the Originals. 

A great example of this is The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings. LOTR is a Sequel to The Hobbit, but Tolkien inverts the story: The Hobbit is about Bilbo trying to find a golden treasure, but LOTR is about Frodo trying to destroy one. In Bilbo's story, it is his love for adventure that is encouraged in the story, and his desire to stay at home in peace that is discouraged and mostly holds him back (though to be fair, this does come in handy for Bilbo when he decides to end the Dwarf/Elf conflict to get back home). In LOTR, it is the reverse; the reason why Frodo and Sam are not corrupted by the Ring for the vast majority of the story is because they both really want to stay at home, in peace, so they are (mostly) not tempted by The Ring promising them power. In fact, when they're in Mordor, Frodo has a paragraph where he talks about not being able to remember his home. He can't recall ""the touch of grass or the sound of birdsong"". This is clever foreshadowing; his connection with home has been eroded by the nightmare of his journey, meaning his desire to go back is diminshed. This is what allows the ring to nearly corrupt Frodo in the end.

The point that I'm making here is that, in LOTR, the story is a sequel that does NOT crap all over the accomplishments of the previous protaganist, Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's adventure is still very much his own, and nothing he did was diminshed by Frodo. Frodo is not somehow a ""better, stronger, wiser, kinder"" figure than Bilbo, not at all; Frodo is his own character, with his own personality traits that are completely different to Bilbo's, so there's no argument that Frodo overshadows Bilbo.

Compare this with the Sequels. They were so DESPERATE to make Rey the new ""STRONG EMPOWERED CHARACTER"" that they had her story utterly crap over everything the Originals stood for. 

""Give Rey her own set of skills and features that make her stand up as her own characters? Nah, that's lame. Let's have her steal all her skills from the old cast instead! First, she'll take Han Solo's piloting skills, and she'll be SO much better at it than him! She'll be so good that Poe, the ""best pilot in the resistence"" will even go as far as to say that Rey is BETTER than him at flying! Next, she'll take Luke's Jedi Skills. Luke will give up on everyone, but Rey will take everything he learned over three years (duelling, mind tricks, levitation) and gain it instantly! We'll also give her 3PO's translating skills, R2's mechanic skills, Leia's escape-planning skills, and we'll make her so powerful in the force that she will take down the Emperor in a battle, which was previously impossible for anyone! Now everyone will be forced to love her!""

No, we won't. If you had just given Rey her own skills and her own personality, people would have viewed her much better than they do now.

PS: Here's me just spitballing an idea on how they could have inverted (not subverted) the Original Trilogy. The OT was about a group of Rebels trying to overthrow a galactic Empire. The Empire uses authoritarian and brutal tactics to stop the Rebels. The Rebels are the good guys, and the Empire are bad.

 In order to invert this, the Sequels should have inverted this. Now that the good guys control the Galactic Republic, should they then use the same brutal and authoritarian tactics to destroy the evil faction? Let's say the New Republic discovers that there are some Imperial Remnants on Yavin IV, and they include important rulers like Thrawn. The New Republic would have access to things like Death Star plans...imagine the moral conundrum there. Does the New Republic decide to use the Death Star to destroy Yavin IV to end the Empire once and for all...or do they refuse on the grounds that this will make them just as bad as the Empire before them?",saltierthancrait,"to jj abrams and rian johnson putting older characters down will not make us like your new characters when creating a new cast for the sequels there are ways the writers could have written them in order to be interesting and compelling to both the new and old generations in order to do this they would have had to show the audeince that these characters have their own personalities while still being worthy successors to the original cast there are many ways to do this one way they could have done this is make the nature of the story utterly different or perhaps even inverted from the originals  great example of this is the hobbit and the lord of the rings lotr is a sequel to the hobbit but tolkien inverts the story the hobbit is about bilbo trying to find a golden treasure but lotr is about frodo trying to destroy one in bilbos story it is his love for adventure that is encouraged in the story and his desire to stay at home in peace that is discouraged and mostly holds him back though to be fair this does come in handy for bilbo when he decides to end the dwarfelf conflict to get back home in lotr it is the reverse the reason why frodo and sam are not corrupted by the ring for the vast majority of the story is because they both really want to stay at home in peace so they are mostly not tempted by the ring promising them power in fact when theyre in mordor frodo has a paragraph where he talks about not being able to remember his home he cant recall the touch of grass or the sound of birdsong this is clever foreshadowing his connection with home has been eroded by the nightmare of his journey meaning his desire to go back is diminshed this is what allows the ring to nearly corrupt frodo in the end point that im making here is that in lotr the story is a sequel that does not crap all over the accomplishments of the previous protaganist bilbo baggins bilbos adventure is still very much his own and nothing he did was diminshed by frodo frodo is not somehow a better stronger wiser kinder figure than bilbo not at all frodo is his own character with his own personality traits that are completely different to bilbos so theres no argument that frodo overshadows bilbo this with the sequels they were so desperate to make rey the new strong empowered character that they had her story utterly crap over everything the originals stood for  rey her own set of skills and features that make her stand up as her own characters nah thats lame lets have her steal all her skills from the old cast instead first shell take han solos piloting skills and shell be so much better at it than him shell be so good that poe the best pilot in the resistence will even go as far as to say that rey is better than him at flying next shell take lukes jedi skills luke will give up on everyone but rey will take everything he learned over three years duelling mind tricks levitation and gain it instantly well also give her 3pos translating skills r2s mechanic skills leias escapeplanning skills and well make her so powerful in the force that she will take down the emperor in a battle which was previously impossible for anyone now everyone will be forced to love her we wont if you had just given rey her own skills and her own personality people would have viewed her much better than they do now  heres me just spitballing an idea on how they could have inverted not subverted the original trilogy the ot was about a group of rebels trying to overthrow a galactic empire the empire uses authoritarian and brutal tactics to stop the rebels the rebels are the good guys and the empire are bad

Constructive feedback & discourse are welcome:**

&#x200B;

**(Note: I'd want a live-action Mara to be reasonably faithful to her source material, but otherwise portrayed as her own take on the character. Therefore, while I understand love for nostalgia, your recommendations needn't be dictated by who most closely resembles EU model Shannon McRandle. Choices of actress aren't restricted to natural redheads either, as there are multiple ways in the entertainment industry to present Mara's color & hairstyle. Ex- Wig or hair dye)**

&#x200B;

**Caitriona Balfe- Now You See Me (2013), Outlander (2014-present), Ford v Ferrari (2019):** Often recognized more by fans of TV's *Outlander*, movie goers could be forgiven for being less familiar with this choice. That said, I'd consider Balfe my 2nd favorite recommendation. She displays solid range to balance the dynamic between Mara's at times fiery temperament vs. gentler, more tender moments. She's only 40 (barely middle-aged by my standards) and more than capable of learning choreography for a lightsaber or blaster. Lastly, she can already do other accents to some extent (English, American, etc). Though not perfectly fluent, she could master a fitting voice for Mara.

&#x200B;

**Karen Gillan-** **Marvel Cinematic Universe** **(2008-present):** Without question, this would be my #1 candidate. In addition to already being a young, beautiful redhead who could easily fit the image in costume, Gillan has demonstrated a capacity to provide the intensity & passion for Mara's personality. She has a successful track record in acting, including good range to learn different accents, as well as experience in both martial arts and combat choreography from her role as Nebula in the MCU + the rebooted *Jumanji* franchise. In my opinion, she'd be the most obvious and overall well rounded choice.

&#x200B;

**Katheryn Winnick-** **Vikings** **(2013-2020):** Despite being the 2nd oldest candidate here, I'd argue that Winnick still looks more than young enough to pull off the character. Or, at the very least, she could portray an older version of her if a significantly younger actor (Ex- Sophie Turner) portrayed Mara in flashbacks of her youth. Yes, without makeup, her natural look doesn't resemble Mara at all but that's why makeup exists. In terms of being qualified for the role's physicality, Winnick is the most experienced on my list. She's known for doing her own stunts and has practiced martial arts from the age of seven (3rd-degree Taekwondo black belt, 2nd-degree Karate black belt). She's a hard working performer who could adapt to the role & voice just as she has playing *Vikings*' Lagertha.

&#x200B;

**Sienna Guillory-** **Resident Evil: Apocalypse** **(2004),** **Resident Evil: Retribution** **(2012):** I can understand why fans would have doubts about this one, considering Guillory is the oldest candidate on my list. Nonetheless, since I first saw her kick butt while bringing Jill Valentine to life on the big screen for the first time, I've thought for years that she could be a fine Mara Jade with the right director & training. Admittedly, Mara Jade lived a substantial life in the EU so seeing her introduced in live-action as a middle-aged woman wouldn't necessarily break immersion by any means. Guillory can still get in good enough shape for the role, and her acting range is decent enough to be convincing.

&#x200B;

**Sienna Miller-** **G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra** **(2009),** **American Sniper** **(2014),** **Burnt** **(2015):** The 2nd youngest recommendation behind Gillan, Miller's past work shows how she can portray a calm, calculating presence or an action-heavy bad-ass as the script demands. While not as experienced in combat choreography, a proficient stuntwoman could make her look good in fight scenes.

&#x200B;

**Honorable mentions:**

&#x200B;

Bridget Moynahan- *i, Robot* (2004), *Blue Bloods* (2010-present)

Emily Rose- *Haven* (2010-2015)

Riley Keough- *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015)

Sophia Bush- *Chicago P.D.* (2014-present)

&#x200B;

**As for which stuntwoman and/or martial artist would be most fitting for Mara's physicality & blade-work, I don't know all the best currently working in those fields but here are three I like:**

So let's say Luke is still reluctant to train Rey. At some point, there's a reveal (maybe from Kylo): Luke killed Rey's parents. Then there's a flashback, where we see Luke brutally slay a (seemingly) helpless man.

Rey flees the island before Luke has a chance to explain what really happened. She takes up Kylo's offer to learn from Snoke.

Like in TLJ though, Snoke has no intention of training her. He probes her mind, and finds out the truth: that she is the true heir to the Empire, and thus the only real threat to his claim of legitimacy to the throne. 

Maybe the audience can be shown the full story: Luke only killed Rey's parents as a last resort in defence. My idea is that they hid her on Jakku for protection, and did intend to come back until Luke defeated them.

Snoke commands Kylo to kill her; instead, as in TLJ Kylo (or Kylo and Rey) defeat Snoke. Now the throne is empty.

Why doesn’t Leia send a squadron to retrieve Luke if finding him was so important?

Why didn’t Leia leave someone temporarily in charge of the Resistance and than gone herself to retrieve him?

Why does Leia specifically wish Rey a “May the Force be with you?” and not Chewie? 

Why does Chewie stay on the Falcon? Why doesn’t he go with Rey to meet Luke? Doesn’t he want to know why luke abandon them and also tell him Han is dead?

a common response I get is “Well, clearly Rey was originally planned to be revealed to be Luke’s daughter and that’s originally why she was sent.”

Ok, let’s assume that is true: that Leia meets Rey and someone finds out she is actually Luke’s lost daughter. Does it really make sense that Leia would send her newly discovered niece on such a top priority mission pretty much right away with only two other people as company. Remember Rey have no personal connection to the rest of the Galaxy since she didn’t know forests existed until very recently. So does it really make sense for a Leia to do that?

Also wouldn’t Leia be a bit more protective of Rey if that was the case? Wouldn’t make more sense that Leia went herself to find Luke and than tell him they found his daughter or gone with Rey to meet up with Luke?

Yet, Screenrant claims that John was mad at TFA for sidelining his character and that JJ downplayed him in TROS, without even mentioning TLJ.

What’s with the cult mentality around Rian Johnson and TLJ? John clearly blamed Rian for not following up on the setup in TFA, but the media can’t fathom the idea that Rian might have been racist, so they say that it’s all JJ’s fault. JJ has his own flaws, but people are willing to point them out, but why can’t Rian be called out?

It’s even among fans. People spent years (and still do) saying Luke was in character, hyperspace ramming is too expensive, and Snoke was irrelevant even though he was the catalyst.

When we first meet Anakin, he's a slave trying to assure himself that he's a person, so he naturally has self-image problems. Then they take him to the Jedi temple. They tell him he's the chosen one. That he has more midichlorians than the grandmaster of the order. He gets all the training he requires, and, as shown by the comics and AotC, he's always the best in his generation. He's powerful and skilled.

After hearing nothing but good things, I knew I needed to give it a watch. At risk of losing my ‘80s card, I had to admit to people I had never seen the original “Karate Kid” films in the 36 years of my life. 

It’s incredibly odd that I’d never had seen them; the “Rocky” series is one of my favorite film series of all time, and the connections between the two series are impossible to ignore. Director John Avildsen helmed “Rocky” and the one that  shall not be named (rhymes with Blocky Hive). Both series feature Bill Conti as composers. Both series are underdog stories that have you furiously rooting for the protagonist. Not least, both series have incredibly successful follow ups that are current and relevant. 

When it comes to sequels, “Rocky” is infamous. From good, to cheesy but good, to bad, to good enough, the “Rocky” series has run the gamut. Say what you will about “Rocky Balboa”, it would have been a fitting end to the franchise that at least took the taste of “Rocky V” out of your mouth. What no one expected, especially regular movie goers, was the “Creed” films to be as good as they are. They hit all the right notes: reverence for the previous films. Respecting the characters and the lore that came before it. Utilizing Rocky and other previous characters in a way that makes sense but also moving forward with new characters. All around amazing films that deserve their place in the Rocky canon. 

While the sequels to “Karate Kid” aren’t quite as revered as the original film, nor as revered as the “Rocky” sequels, there is still a very strong fanbase for those films, as well as casual fans who remember them. “Cobra Kai” accomplishes an insanely possible feat: capture the hearts of both groups of people 30+ years after the franchise had ended. It maintains its reverence to the original films, honors the lore, and respects and uses the old characters while moving forward with new characters. It’s simply an amazing thing to see happen with something you’d never expect to get that treatment.

TFA was understandable. You’re following the disliked Prequels, and gotta show people that Star Wars can be good again while making a sequel to a story that is very clearly finished. So soft reboot. I didn’t *like* it, but I understood why they did it and knew that it left things open to be explored in sequels. 

TRoS was inevitable. You’re making a sequel to a film most people hated that left no hooks for a sequel and the last film in the franchise was one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, and it’s also the finale of all of Star Wars. So bite the bullet, bring back Palpatine, and go for spectacle. There was no way for it to be good, but it was a Hail Mary and really the only card Lucasfilm had to play after the train wreck that was TLJ. 

But TLJ...I still can’t wrap my head around it. They had audiences eating out of the palm of their hand after TFA and they decided to punch them in the face. Literally every single creative choice did not work and in many cases was outright disrespectful to the other films in the franchise. I felt like Rian Johnson was making fun of me for liking Star Wars. I was just some guy in his early 20s and I was literally sitting *in the theater on opening weekend* thinking “This is kind of bad. People aren’t going to like this”. How did *I* see that but nobody at Disney of Lucasfilm saw it? 

Mark Hamill was *screaming* at them that they had to think of the fans. He was ignored. Trevorrow left IX because he couldn’t get a story to work after TLJ. Maybe those were signs that what they were doing wasn’t working. An idiot could have read the screenplay to TLJ and tell them that it wasn’t going to work.

4. Why doesn't he have a real name?  Or a way to contact him like a cellphone?
5. Why let someone make a movie that insults it's fans if you want money from the movie?
6. Is anyone actually in charge of Disney?  They didn't notice until three movies were out Kathleen fucked everything up.  Were people banned from contacting higher authority?

They didn't notice when JJ was fired over Rian, who was adamant and vocal about his hate for Star Wars (see question 5).   They didn't notice Kathleen fucked of their diversity movement TWICE (three if you count Holdo).  There were multiple shoots of the Rise of Skywalker (six rumored) and KATHLEEN was in charge of which one to use (I wanted to see Ashsoka live action, damnnit) after ruining two movies (see previous sentence).  Not to mention, it took over 5 years for a muppet show and neither Henson, nor trusted pal is in charge.  Pixar is doing nothing.  Animation studios are doing nothing.  Fox has been left to its own devices, as has Marvel.  Last, and most importantly: HOW DID NO ONE IN DISNEY EVER STOP AND POINT OUT HOW BIG OF A CASH COW MARK HAMILL IS?

785,The one thing we have learned from the Disney Trilogy: NEVER believe people know what they’re doing unless you’re sure,25,ipkqnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ipkqnj/the_one_thing_we_have_learned_from_the_disney/,5,1599702359.0,"After TFA came out, all of us should have been sceptical. We should have assumed that the unanswered questions had no answers planned out, and that they were just there to make people keep taking about BS fan theories. 

We should have realised JJ and Disney has no clue what they were doing, and given TFA negative reviews as a result. We should have demanded that all future film writers prove to us that they know what they’re doing, and that they know the direction they’re going to take, rather than just give us a film with no answers and no ideas.

I mean on any objective measure that pairing is  just horrible.  You can't have a story about a strong powerful women and want to make her end up with an abusive person. People say Rey sends a good message to girls. No, no she does not. 

 Kylo- Is a literal genocidal monster. He kills  women and children and heck men for that matter who are not a part of his war. He stood with those who blew up  5 worlds ( some people even try to take away the blame for this) .  If he was blameless he would have left the FO, and tried to stop them. But he didn't and he kept them doing their same stuff. So even if someone said he had nothing to with that. The fact that he stayed around shows that he is okay with it. And when it comes to Rey personally. HE kidnaps her , mind rapes her, throws her into a tree so hard she is knocked out. Do you know how hard you have to throw someone into something for them to be knocked out that long. Then gaslights her calling her nothing. Trying to kill her friends. Stalks her , rips stuff off of her, tries to kill her some more.  And because he gave her goo goo eyes one in cave people suggest this is a great romance . There is literally nothing romantic about their interactions. He is a horrible from the start, horrible in the middle and only stops being horrible when 98% of the movie is a gone. I asked people besides the very end, what selfless thing did he ever do for Rey. Most people draw a plank. And other people highlight the Thrown room. But that wasn't selfless, he wanted to use her power to help his. That is why right after he tried to kill the people she just met and befriended. If it was truly a selfless act then he would not have tried to do that. He tries to cut her off from everyone else. That is a classic move by abusers. 

 

This isn't like Batman and Catwoman.99% of the time Catwoman is not written as someone who tries to the Kill batman, they fight and she steals stuff but she isn't a monster.  Even in her early days it has been a more of a violent game of cat and mouse . (ha)  So that pairing is understand if you want a enemy  to lover plot.   I was going to liken this to something else that was bad , but I really can't think of a something that comes close to that.  But the situation just bothers me be years later people are still holding this up setup when it comes to treatment of a woman. Which it is not. When it comes to treatment of minorities, which it is not.  This is trope that happens still from time to time. They have a minority and they are with a group of a white people. And in place of connecting him with a white character the drop a random minority in the mix for him to hit on after of know where.  And like this was done years ago, and they brought that back for TLJ while at the time displaying the worst romance I think I have ever seen.

We get the raid of the village, We get so how the raid effects Finn and of course Rey’s introduction. However I feel like the movie starts to fall apart and become a lot more well... dumber the moment Finn rescues Poe:

* Not only is Finn’s emotional trauma completely gone and never addressed again but Finn also starts to murder other Stormtroopers without any hints of remorse or confliction.

* Rey who in her introduction was established as a struggling scavenger that had to work hard every day to barely makes ends meet suddenly turns into a superhuman that has all sorts of different skills that makes little to no sense given her established backstory.

* It is also here were all the ridiculous coincidences starts to emerge: Finn just happens to crash land within walking distance from BB-8 who has the map to Luke, And then it is revealed that Luke’s brother-in-law Han’s ship just happened to be there, and then it turns out Han just happened to be close enough to Jakku to detect and track down the Falcon only a few minutes after leaving Jakku, and then the place Han takes them just happens to have Luke’s old lightsaber, and then Rey he’s kidnapped and after escaping her cell she just happens to run into Han, Chewie and Finn on a Base that is THE SIZE OF A PLANET.

811,Homelander from The Boys is everything Kylo Ren should've been.,70,ip1s6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/ip1s6m/homelander_from_the_boys_is_everything_kylo_ren/,31,1599626675.0,"Spoilers for The Boys Seasons 1 & 2 ahead.

I finally got around to watching The Boys, and while watching it, I was struck by how similarly Homelander's storyline mirrors what the ST tried to accomplish with Kylo Ren, at least in TFA and TLJ.

 First off, his motives for being such a selfish, cruel bastard make sense, and the story doesn't try to sugarcoat it. All his life, Homelander was raised in a lab, treated like a test subject and not as a human being. And as the leader of The Seven, his ego and sense of pride are fed everyday by the corporate yes-men at Vought. As such, we understand WHY he treats his teammates like garbage, and feels no shame about allowing a jet-full of people to die and spinning to serve his own ends. His upbringing simply didn't allow for the necessary human emotions and feelings to become part of him. Compared to Kylo Ren who is just as murderous and violent as Homelander (massacring a village of innocents, murdering his father and being party to interstellar genocide) but the movie tries to tell us he's simply a good kid gone bad. Kylo was raised by a pair of busy parents, and a prestigious, legendsry uncle. All 3 of them cared about him (and anything otherwise requires some drastic OOC-ness from HLL) and the best explanation we get for his motives is a line about Snoke getting to him in TFA and Luke trying to kill him because of his naughty dreams. But since the only reason Luke tried to kill him is because he thought he was bad, we just get this awful circular logic that goes nowhere. Homelander is bad because of his awful upbringing, Kylo is bad...because he was bad. Either that or his Imaginary Friend Snoke told him to burn things. 

Because of how well his backstory influences his actions, Homelander's moments of vulnerability feel earned. When Stillwell exploits his obsession with her throughout Season 1 to keep him in line, we understand more about how deeply his upbringing screwed him up. We see that deep down, he simply wants affection and love, but doesn't know how to give or undertsand it. This is further underlined by moments like his encounter with his childhood blanket, or when his son fails to display the same potential as him right off the bat. Homlander's self-control and personable exterior disappear, and his violent, merciless self is on display. The story never use these moments to excuse him, but rather to use him as an example of how necessary love and tenderness is to creating stable, emotionally healthy people. Kylo's moments of vulnerability ARE used to try and excuse him. The only exception is perhaps in TFA where his murder of Han seemed to set Kylo on an irredeemable path (until one day it didn't.) When Kylo talks to Vader's helmet about the pull to the light or he talks with Rey in TLJ, it is framed as the goodness in Ren trying to break free. When seen in the context of his actions and upbringing however, the scenes fall flat. He is evil simply because he wants to be, and resists any attempt to be good. He is not worth redeeming. 

Finally, the narrative beats both characters share are executed far better in Homelander's case. Both he and Ren kill the abusive mentor who was controlling them (Stillwell and Snoke), but in Homelander's case it was properly foreshadowed, and actually carried over meaningfully into his character in S2. Kylo's killing of Snoke could have worked if it wasn't undercut by the very next movie. Both characters have moments that are meant to solidify their irredeemability (Homelander destroying the planes in S1, Kylo killing Han) but the difference is that The Boys commits to this and never tries to present Homelander as anything other than evil afterwards. Because the there wasn't enough coherence between movies in the ST, TLJ directly undercuts this moment for Kylo. Conflict with co-workers, jockeying for power and influence is something both characters share. Even after killing Stillwell, Homelander clashes with Mr. Edgar over the direction of The Seven, and has to fend off Stormfront's attempts to steal his position. Kylo's arguments with Hux in TFA come off as 2 petulant children whining about bullshit, and Hux is just a complete ass-clown in TLJ, never really a threat to Kylo at all. The romantic relationships both characters are in are virtually the same, but how their respective stories treat them is quite telling. Homelander is abusive and controlling in his relationships with Queen Maeve and Rebecca Butcher, murdering anyone who could steal the former away from him (even when he is not romantically involved with her) and trying to take away the latter's agency when raising their son. Kylo is just as abusive towards Rey, physically attacking her and her friends, making her feel isolated and worthless, etc. However, Homelander is clearly and unequivocally treated as in the wrong for his actions. Kylo gets a pass at the end just because he WASN'T trying to murder Rey for once. Imagine if The Boys S3 ends with Maeve and Homelander kissing after he makes a half-assed attempt at helping her fight Edgar (who is now an evil space wizard all of a sudden.) That's essentially what happened with Rey and Kylo.

TLDR; Homelander has a similar character arc to Kylo in terms of situations and actions, but the way their stories handle them show how superior The Boys is to the Sequels.",saltierthancrait,"homelander from the boys is everything kylo ren shouldve been spoilers for the boys seasons 1  2 ahead finally got around to watching the boys and while watching it i was struck by how similarly homelanders storyline mirrors what the st tried to accomplish with kylo ren at least in tfa and tlj

 first off his motives for being such a selfish cruel bastard make sense and the story doesnt try to sugarcoat it all his life homelander was raised in a lab treated like a test subject and not as a human being and as the leader of the seven his ego and sense of pride are fed everyday by the corporate yesmen at vought as such we understand why he treats his teammates like garbage and feels no shame about allowing a jetfull of people to die and spinning to serve his own ends his upbringing simply didnt allow for the necessary human emotions and feelings to become part of him compared to kylo ren who is just as murderous and violent as homelander massacring a village of innocents murdering his father and being party to interstellar genocide but the movie tries to tell us hes simply a good kid gone bad kylo was raised by a pair of busy parents and a prestigious legendsry uncle all 3 of them cared about him and anything otherwise requires some drastic oocness from hll and the best explanation we get for his motives is a line about snoke getting to him in tfa and luke trying to kill him because of his naughty dreams but since the only reason luke tried to kill him is because he thought he was bad we just get this awful circular logic that goes nowhere homelander is bad because of his awful upbringing kylo is badbecause he was bad either that or his imaginary friend snoke told him to burn things  of how well his backstory influences his actions homelanders moments of vulnerability feel earned when stillwell exploits his obsession with her throughout season 1 to keep

Except for the fact that the new republic was destroyed in episode 7 and any hope for a new jedi order died with Luke. With the new republic and the first order gone, who's running the galaxy? Who's making sure that systems don't go to war with each other and perhaps start a new galactic spanning conflict? Who??

Let's take the original trilogy as an example; the emperor is dead(and should have stayed that way), Vader is dead, the death star is destroyed, and the empire is in shambles. The new republic is founded shortly after in order to consolidate and maintain their territory and resources for the continuation of the war. This was the original goal of the rebellion, why all these people got together. A vacuum opened and was sealed quickly. So let's go back to the original question, who is going to fill the vacuum left by now two major galactic powers? Rey and the resistance? Everyone just decides to become friends and work in peace? A union of systems similar to that of the UN? I don't believe so. Star Wars is not a utopian dreamscape. Without a central galactic government, war and chaos will be widespread. When governments fall, warlords pop up and attempt to gain more resources, territory, power. Is the resistance going to bring them to heel? Both iterations of the republic were flawed, but they had their place as a way to allow diplomacy and reason to attempt to control this universal chaos. 

With the death of the entirety of the Skywalker bloodline, and the fact that no other force sensitiveness people were really shown, the jedi are truly dead. Now this can be seen as a good thing as the jedi philosophy were heavily flawed to the point that that's what destroyed them in the first place, but what happens when the with or another group of darksiders rise up? The jedi had their place, like the republic, in the maintaining of a galactic peace. Without a unified organization of light-side force users or a galactic union, any start up darksider or warlord could take over a good portion of the galaxy.

As someone who enjoys studying the rise and fall of nation's and the factors that lead to them, the ending of the sequels makes me angry. The disregard for planning for what happens after the credits roll is comparable to Game of Thrones season 8, which(spoilers, kinda) will lead to another war within one or two generations.

I know it may be impractical, but I think it would be cool to see Thrawn finally coming onto the big screen. Obviously, there would need to be some adjustments to the story, such as making Thrawn a bit older since he was in Rebels. I think someone like Jeremy Irons would be amazing at voicing an aged Thrawn. 

Also, there would be the issue of casting. I think Mark Hamill would at least be interested in the idea of reprising his role of Luke Skywalker for this trilogy, but I don't feel like Harrison Ford would be down to come back as Han, especially not after the sequels. Maybe we could ask Alden Ehrenreich to do it?There's also the obvious question of who would replace Carrie Fisher (may she RIP) as Princess Leia. I also feel like Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels would like to return as Lando and C-3P0. 

I also think it would be interesting for (and I know this part may be a bit touchy) Dave to introduce some of his own characters into the story and see how they would interact with it.

If you assume that Luke is about 20 in anh (which is reasonable as he is shown as an adult but still very young), then he would be 25ish in rotj. Leia, being Luke’s twin, is the same age.

Han is protracted as an experienced pilot, and in solo (which according to the article takes place about 10 years bby) he seems to be about the same age like is in anh (20ish). So ten years later he’d be 30ish, and another four he’d be 35ish. 

Tfa is 34 aby (30 years after rotj) so Luke and Leia would be 55ish, and jam would be 65ish. Fair enougg

But in tfa (and tlj) Han Luke and Leia are all 70+ year old veterans who are too old for this shit. It makes no sense, and it would be ridiculously easy to shift the trilogy by 10-15 years. All you’d need to do is switch some dialogue for some slightly different dialogue it’s so easy but they gotta stick to the whole 30 year bullshit that makes no sense

Also, if tfa is only 30 years later, rotj is really recent. Return of the Jedi is equivalent to 1990. If a war the fate of the world happened in 1990 we’d be pretty bloody aware of it, but Rey (and Han to some extent (and literally everyone else)) act like it’s ancient fucking history.

So much have changed in a way that is not only a huge disservice to the OT but also makes absolutely no sense like why would Han go back to being a smuggler in a Galaxy that is no longer ruled by a tyrannical Empire but a Republic he helped form especially given that he would now be a famous war hero and could earn money in countless other legal ways. Also because no criminal organization would ever want to hire him now after what happened to Jabba.

It fails as a reboot because the movie isn’t good at all at introduction new audiences to the lore. A reboot should be made in a way that newcomers will understand the world the movie is set in but The Force Awakens doesn’t do that because it doesn’t explain things like The Force, The Jedi or the mind trick and just assumes that the audience already knows about them.

It fails as a stand alone movie because it has pretty much no merits on its own. When I ask people what they liked about it pretty much the only answers I get is how cool it was to see (insert something OT related again) or what it might have setup for the sequels. 

Speaking of which it fails as a setup for sequels because it leaves way to much things unanswered to the point that its would have been nearly impossible for a sequel to answer them all in a satisfying way that makes sense but also because what exactly was the story suppose to go from there?

Rey has already mastered the Force, The First Order just lost its greatest weapon and their main base and two of their leaders Kylo and Phasma has been beaten meaning they would be pretty much screwed right now.

Im just gonna list some more reasons because its 5am rn and im too tired to write a well structured coherent breakdown:

-the human population was 6.2billion in 2002, this is over 20% less than it is now (this is quite self-explanatory as to why less people would go to watch the prequels)

-as i said previously about paving the way for a wider audience, iron man 1 made 585million dollars in box office revenue whereas iron man 3 made 1.2billion and even iron man 2 made 600mil+.

How did they think this was a good idea? On one hand they tried to hard to recapture the OT by making it a rebels vs empire situation even though that made no sense, but on the other they totally disrespected the OT.

There are basically millions of different takes, but if it was up to me, I would have made it a empire vs rebels situation where the rebels became the overarching power, like a good empire and the empire became the rebels, in that they were a small group rebelling a greater power, similar to how star wars was kind of ww2 in space, this would make more sense since we live in the war on terror environment. Maybe the bad guys can win and do a reversal later, but I think that'd need more than 3 movies.

I was really excited, since the original Mulan was one of my favorite childhood movies (I still find myself humming the tunes of some of the songs).

Unfortunately, I was in for a disappointing 2 hours. I had heard beforehand that there would be no songs, no Mu-Shu, and no ghostly ancestors, so I thought I tempered my expectations accordingly. “I guess this movie is going to leave the childish fantasies and comedy behind to focus on one of the greatest hero’s journeys ever written?”

Well, no.

Modern Disney has once again proven that they’d rather sacrifice good story telling and character development for an action flick that appeals to the masses. It was essentially 2 hours of poorly shot martial arts, with Mulan coming out on top in every possible instance. She achieved unbelievable physical feats with little to no training and the help of a very rare but powerful force called chi, that very few can yield(sound familiar?). 

While the original character Mulan needed to use bravery and cunning to overcome her obstacles, the new Mulan didn’t really have any. She was inexplicably far stronger than all of her counterparts, and sliced and diced dozens of men with ease. A beloved tale of defending honor and rebelling against cultural norms just became another butchering of a beloved character. 

What Disney doesn’t seem to understand is that a protagonist needs faults. A protagonist needs triumphs. A protagonist needs defeats. I need a bigger reason to route for someone than them being in the middle of the poster. Characters should be complex and vulnerable, not impervious.

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you’ve seen the film, or if you have any ideas about how to better handle and protect strong characters in the new Disney age.

We thought given the fact that John Boyega has slowly become the ultimate Salt Miner and its pretty much a given that Finn deserved better.

**So, we ask you the simple question: How would you Fix Finn in the sequel trilogy?**

out of all of the sequel trilogy characters, Finn was probably the most original character who had an interesting background that hadn't been seen in the movies before. A strong introduction showing the horrors of war that a stormtrooper goes through, many people had seen great potential in Finn.

Though as we all know by know, that potential was never achieved.

As a Black man who has loved Star Wars since he was a youngling young to be on Anakin's hit list, I was excited for Finn but found myself disappointed by thoroughly with the sequels. Probably the biggest waste of a great concept I've ever seen from a character that started out as a co-protagonist then turned into just a shadow who only got a concept moment once per movie. That is unless those moments ended up on the cutting room floor.

The entire premise of TFA is find Luke Skywalker because as Snoke puts it, “if Skywalker returns, the New Jedi will rise.” The FO sees the Jedi as threat to their rule either in the short or long term and the Resistance would presumably want these Jedi on their side down the road and thus both sides spend the entire film up until the very end searching for Luke. This is the culmination of the film, so it doesn’t make any sense that this would lead to the whole film being rendered pointless in TLJ by making Luke a failure that **does nothing in the entire story.**

Even the things surrounding his exile in TFA back this up. Who left the map if Luke gave up? The goal of any map is to *find* something and if Luke doesn’t want to be found, its existence doesn’t make any sense regardless of who made it. If Luke did give up, then writing in a map contradicts that on a basic level. Luke also went to the first Jedi Temple and I don’t even need to use fan theories here, as someone doesn’t lose faith and then decide to spend their last days at its birthplace. The big counter argument is Han’s line, “Luke walked away from all of it,” but we can’t really extrapolate anything from it as it could mean he gave up or he needed time to reflect or something else. Plus, Han doesn’t even know where he went, so how does he know why he left?

I’m not saying Luke was done great by TFA, but there’s nothing to suggest that he gave up or nothing we can prove.

I'm saddened to see that this is looked over by a majority of Salt Miners, who likely don't see it because it's overshadowed by how awful the rest of the writing is.

So, what is the First Order? Mistake #1: We don't know. We are never told in any of the films what they are, who they are, and why they exist. I am aware of the *very* interconnected web of comics and material designed by Disney to tell us why the First Order exists, but I don't want to read 25+ books & 9 \* 10\^5 comics to see why the evil institution exists, I want to be told by the movies.

I am not some person who hates reading, far from it - I love reading and that's the only reason I know half of why the First Order exists (the other half is buried in the 9 \* 10\^5 comics/graphic novels that I have no interest in reading). Let me tell you upfront - those books are terrible. ***T E R R I B L E***. If you don't believe me read Chuck Wendig's Aftermath Trilogy. Actually, don't, it will make you doubt humanity's ability to write.

Why does the First Order exist? Because some die-hard imperials decided to reform the GE into something ""better"" (I swear these poor writers have to stoop to the lowest common denominator to explain something because Jar Jar Abrams and Ryan Johnson have no ability whatsoever). This makes no sense, the general consensus is that everyone in the GE was focused on one thing and one thing only - power (and to a lesser extent money). Every single official, bureaucrat, general, or admiral was interesting in power and the emperor's favor (as the emperor was the fountainhead of power). This makes sense, because these people were trying to provide for themselves (and maybe their families), giving them a better life than the poor, impoverished, starving masses.

I get that the FO is supposed to be the remnants of the Galactic Empire banding together. If this is true, then why is it called the First Order? If these people were really this jingoistic, they would call themselves the Galactic Empire. And I know that it's because it's Emperor Palpatine's Contingency Plan, but anyone jingoistic enough to keep fighting when everything is clearly over obviously cares more about the idea of the empire (for some reason) rather than the person in charge (who is dead). 

 Why weren't we told that the First Order is named because of Palpatine's Contingency Plan? That would have been nice. I don't want to read a separate book series in order to know that. I love reading, but I don't want to have to study something to understand a movie. Also, I read the Aftermath Trilogy, and can I just say that it is *The Worst Book Series I have ever read*. I've read fanfiction better than those books.

 Why are there new Stormtrooper designs? If the Galactic Empire has been defeated, and the First Order is the remnants of the empire + Contingency Plan Supplies, then the First Order Troopers should be in raggedy, broken down, dirty, scraps of armor, like shown in the Mandalorian (Best thing to come out of Disney having Star Wars). If the remnants of the Empire are so jingoistic that they want to continue the empire, they should be trying to continue all of the empire, including the stormtrooper designs.

Why are they more powerful than the Galactic Empire? They aren't directly *said* to be stronger, but they are portrayed that way by Jar Jar Abrams's directing. If they are the remnants and mothballed ships, they should be weaker than the Galactic Empire. They have been driven back into the Unknown Regions, then they shouldn't be a titan of industry, such as the empire was, who controlled the entire rest of the galaxy.  It's noticeable that the technology hasn't changed at all in the fleets, so they must have more fleets. More fleets require resources. I doubt that the First Order, a puny thing, only covering the Unknown Regions has more resources than the entire rest of the galaxy combined. If this was true, then the Unknown Regions should have been settled millenia before Palpatine was even *born*.  Why didn't the CIS colonize the Unknown Regions? Why didn't the Empire colonize the systems? Bad hyperlanes & bad navigation? Then how come the First Order could do it?

To continue why them being in the Unknown Regions is stupid, there's still more:  Things already exist in the Unknown Regions, The Chiss Ascendency & a new threat called the Grysk, both of which are cannon, according to the **new cannon** Thrawn Trilogy. The Chiss Ascendency would have snuffed them out instantly, and even if they didn't (for some reason), the Grysk would have been more than happy to turn them into mind-controlled slaves.

Not only that, but apparently they steal children and practice cloning to make their armies.  This is just stupid, what are they now, Barbaric Despoilers from Stellaris? Cloning is expensive. The Republic was able to afford it because it was a galactic organization, who needed a fighting force. I doubt Palpatine would include Cloning Equipment in the Contingency Plan, so where are they getting the equipment & money to clone soldiers? Not only that, but stealing children to make them soldiers is a *really, really,* ***really***, bad idea. You have to raise the child and feed it and clothe it and train it and a whole other list of requirements for 16-20 years just to produce one soldier - the numbers speak for themselves, it's a really dumb idea.

Starkiller Base also makes zero sense. If the *entire* Galactic Empire was only able to build a moon sized weapons station, then some rogue sect in the Unknown Regions can't figure out how to:

1. Hollow out a planet
2. Fill this new shell with machinery
3. Figure out how to harvest a star - technology which is never brought up again BTW
4. Figure out how to store the energy of an entire star
5. Figure out how to fire said energy
6. Figure out how to fire it through hyperspace
7. Figure out how to make it split into 7 perfect pieces to fire into the planets

The fleet being destroyed as well is also stupid, as we never *see* the fleet or it being destroyed, note J.J., *important detail*.

916,"Boyega, and the egoshoppe leaks revisited.",35,im9u2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/im9u2o/boyega_and_the_egoshoppe_leaks_revisited/,59,1599224461.0,"So approaching the release of RoS last year there were rumors of tension between JJ and Disney. Some of the rumors were reported by our own mod egoshoppe in fact - presented as leaked information he got from an insider.

The egoshoppe leaks were controversial for being uncomfirmed and also because they seemed to be trying to absolve JJ of responsibility for a bad movie and blaming Disney for meddling when everyone knew a Frankensteinian stinker was coming, stitched together out of different endings and reshoots, so maybe JJ loyalists were making excuses?

Supposedly Disney were upset that JJ was moving to DC to start competing with Marvel movies and this led to tension and even sabotage? (Disney sabotaging its own prize film seems unlikely to me even now, but I buy the idea that they might have sought to blame JJ for it ahead of time, though I don't think that was part of the leak of the period.)

There is a line that John Boyega delivers in his GQ interview that caught my attention, regarding JJ.

>“Everybody needs to leave my boy alone. He wasn’t even supposed to come back and try to save your shit”

The 'your' in question seems to be Disney and the 'everyone' seems to be about Disney as well when you think about how that sentence veered and also the fact that it comes after he name-checked Disney for misleading on the role of minority characters. 

He seems to be saying that Disney needs to leave JJ alone. Has Disney been driving unfavorable press for JJ whether through leaks or other means? Or maybe 'everyone' and 'your' referred to fans of TLJ who say JJ betrayed Rian Johnson's 'bold' direction in TLJ (Patrick Willems for instance)?

It is clear from their personal history that Boyega is loyal to the point of ignoring JJ's faults. (JJ liked Attack the Block and had promised to cast Boyega in something even before JJ was in charge of Star Wars). So maybe Boyega is just lashing out at phantoms to defend JJ's honor? Or was there truth to the rumor of a JJ/Disney feud in the production?

Either way, what is CLEAR and perhaps the biggest bombshell of the interview is that Boyega seems to think that JJ and Disney (and Boyega himself) all considered TLJ a failure or at least a misfire. The phrase 'fix your shit' doesn't come out of nowhere. In the past Boyega has mentioned that his close friends hated TLJ and the way TLJ treated the character of Finn. And in the GQ interview, the interviewer summarizes Boyega as talking about  ""the relative salvage job that returnee director JJ Abrams performed on The Rise Of Skywalker ""

No salvage is needed if TLJ wasn't a misfire. 

And Boyega wouldn't talk about JJ coming back to fix things if he didn't have an awareness that Disney and JJ understood it as a return to fix things.

Unless maybe he's merely referring to JJ coming back to fix the schedule after the firing of Trevorrow? Maybe he's saying JJ tried to fix the lack of depth in Finn's portrayal?

Maybe I'm reading too much into this?

At the very least, I think the biggest news to come out of Boyega's interview is that RoS was made in panic mode by everyone involved.",saltierthancrait,boyega and the egoshoppe leaks revisited so approaching the release of ros last year there were rumors of tension between jj and disney some of the rumors were reported by our own mod egoshoppe in fact  presented as leaked information he got from an insider egoshoppe leaks were controversial for being uncomfirmed and also because they seemed to be trying to absolve jj of responsibility for a bad movie and blaming disney for meddling when everyone knew a frankensteinian stinker was coming stitched together out of different endings and reshoots so maybe jj loyalists were making excuses disney were upset that jj was moving to dc to start competing with marvel movies and this led to tension and even sabotage disney sabotaging its own prize film seems unlikely to me even now but i buy the idea that they might have sought to blame jj for it ahead of time though i dont think that was part of the leak of the period is a line that john boyega delivers in his gq interview that caught my attention regarding jj needs to leave my boy alone he wasn’t even supposed to come back and try to save your shit” your in question seems to be disney and the everyone seems to be about disney as well when you think about how that sentence veered and also the fact that it comes after he namechecked disney for misleading on the role of minority characters  seems to be saying that disney needs to leave jj alone has disney been driving unfavorable press for jj whether through leaks or other means or maybe everyone and your referred to fans of tlj who say jj betrayed rian johnsons bold direction in tlj patrick willems for instance is clear from their personal history that boyega is loyal to the point of ignoring jjs faults jj liked attack the block and had promised to cast boyega in something even before jj was in charge of star wars so maybe boyega is just lashing out at phantoms to defend jjs honor or was there truth to the rumor of a jjdisney feud in the production way what is clear and perhaps the biggest bombshell of the interview is that boyega seems to think that jj and disney and boyega himself all considered tlj a failure or at least a misfire the phrase fix your shit doesnt come out of nowhere in the past boyega has mentioned that his close friends hated tlj and the way tlj treated the character of finn and in the gq interview the interviewer summarizes boyega as talking about  the relative salvage job that returnee director jj abrams performed on the rise of skywalker  salvage is needed if tlj wasnt a misfire  boyega wouldnt talk about jj coming back to fix things if he didnt have an awareness that disney and jj understood it as a return to fix things maybe hes merely referring to jj coming back to fix the schedule after the firing of trevorrow maybe hes saying jj tried to fix the lack of depth in finns portrayal im reading too much into this the very least i think the biggest news to come out of boyegas interview is that ros was made in panic mode by everyone involved,1,3160,564,1,0.128,0.727,0.145,0.9217
917,Incrediblies 2 suffers from very similar sequel problems as The Last Jedi.,29,im9ipm,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/im9ipm/incrediblies_2_suffers_from_very_similar_sequel/,7,1599223029.0,"I was watching NitPix’s [Incrediblies 2 is a bad Sequel](https://youtu.be/_NpWxANyhk8) and realized that some of te issues that he shows ib the video are similar to TLJ.

Incredibles 2 is suppose to take place immediately after the first movie just like the Last Jedi but the tune is completely different like the Last Jedi

The first movie ended on a positive note with the family(including Jack-Jack) suiting up to fight the underminer which indicates that the family is now a big team.

But in the sequel just like the characters in TLJ the characters seems to have regressed immediately. They don’t work to together well at all, they argue over who should fight and who should look after Jack-Jack. 

Bob suddenly has a hard time taking care of Violet and Dash even though in the montage in the first movie we see him have a completely healthy and functional relationship with them.

Helen was a lot about “we must prioritize our family instead of hero work” in the first movie but in the sequel she is suddenly a thrill seeking hero addict she chastised Bob for being in the first movie.

Violet is suddenly completely obsessed with her Tony. In the first movie her arc was about her gaining confidence in herself and when Tony asks her out at the end she doesn’t seem to care that much but in the sequel everything about her revolves around Tony.

Dash is just kind of there.

Jack-Jack seemed to have been retconned completely so that we can have a scene were Bob finds out he has powers within the sequel even though this doesn’t make a lot of sense. In the animated “short” Jack-Jack attacks that I assume is still Canon we see how the nanny Jack-Jack was left with has to deal with him suddenly developing powers and then see how the Nanny got her memories wiped about it all by Bob’s agent friend Rick Dicker.

Did Rick never mentioned to Bob that he had wiped the memories of their nanny and mentioned Jack-Jack’s sudden powers to him?

*”Hey, Bob. We wiped the memories of your nanny, congratulations on the Baby’s Powers BTW”*

Also there are other inconsistencies like in the first movie you got the feeling that the Underminor declared war on Humanity but in the sequel all he tries to do is rob a bank or how the family not being able to return to hero work is suddenly a big deal. At the end of the first movie you got the impression that super hero work was accepted again after the family took out the robot but in the sequel it suddenly isn’t.

So yeah. Incredibles 2 suffers from similar sequel problems like the Last Jedi since there are bizarre inconsistencies between the first movie and the sequel both in terms of character and setting even though it suppose to take place just after the first movie.

Weird that the sequel was actually made by the same person who made the first movie. With the TLJ the inconsistencies are more understandable given that the movie’s were made by different people.",saltierthancrait,incrediblies 2 suffers from very similar sequel problems as the last jedi i was watching nitpix’s incrediblies 2 is a bad sequel and realized that some of te issues that he shows ib the video are similar to tlj 2 is suppose to take place immediately after the first movie just like the last jedi but the tune is completely different like the last jedi first movie ended on a positive note with the familyincluding jackjack suiting up to fight the underminer which indicates that the family is now a big team in the sequel just like the characters in tlj the characters seems to have regressed immediately they don’t work to together well at all they argue over who should fight and who should look after jackjack  suddenly has a hard time taking care of violet and dash even though in the montage in the first movie we see him have a completely healthy and functional relationship with them was a lot about “we must prioritize our family instead of hero work” in the first movie but in the sequel she is suddenly a thrill seeking hero addict she chastised bob for being in the first movie is suddenly completely obsessed with her tony in the first movie her arc was about her gaining confidence in herself and when tony asks her out at the end she doesn’t seem to care that much but in the sequel everything about her revolves around tony is just kind of there seemed to have been retconned completely so that we can have a scene were bob finds out he has powers within the sequel even though this doesn’t make a lot of sense in the animated “short” jackjack attacks that i assume is still canon we see how the nanny jackjack was left with has to deal with him suddenly developing powers and then see how the nanny got her memories wiped about it all by bob’s agent friend rick dicker rick never mentioned to bob that he had wiped the memories of their nanny and mentioned jackjack’s sudden powers to him bob we wiped the memories of your nanny congratulations on the baby’s powers btw” there are other inconsistencies like in the first movie you got the feeling that the underminor declared war on humanity but in the sequel all he tries to do is rob a bank or how the family not being able to return to hero work is suddenly a big deal at the end of the first movie you got the impression that super hero work was accepted again after the family took out the robot but in the sequel it suddenly isn’t yeah incredibles 2 suffers from similar sequel problems like the last jedi since there are bizarre inconsistencies between the first movie and the sequel both in terms of character and setting even though it suppose to take place just after the first movie that the sequel was actually made by the same person who made the first movie with the tlj the inconsistencies are more understandable given that the movie’s were made by different people,1,2999,534,1,0.084,0.77,0.147,0.9923

The only exception is ROTJ which focuses on the characters in the first paragraph (Luke’s quest for Han), the next provides overall setup (Death Star II), and the third is direct setup (Rebels last chance). None of the ST films do this properly.

TFA takes the ROTJ route and devotes two paragraphs to character stuff (the disappearance and search for Luke) and then the last provides direct setup (the discovery on Jakku). But notice how overall worldbuilding and context is missing? While the worldbuilding is small in ROTJ, it’s not a problem because we know so much after two films already, but to have no context for a brand new story is problematic. Without any clear understanding of the political climate the story suffers throughout all 3 films. Resurrecting the Empire and creating the Resistance that disrupts the logical flow of the narrative requires more than a hand wave.

TLJ does follow the normal path, but it’s largely pointless because there’s no time skip, which is a separate issue for the film. The first paragraph does provide nice info about the political climate (one of the few examples), in that the FO reigns, however, it’s never elaborated on or shown leaving it feel hollow and weak.

TROS also follows the normal pattern, but swings too far in the other direction from TFA’s problem and it becomes a crutch, as Palpatine is brought back from the dead off-screen. The crawls should provide context, which is relevant information that can be explored just as effectively by being shown or told, but when the context has consequences that we cannot see then it’s a problem. In ROTS, Palpatine is kidnapped off-screen, but the consequences- his rescue- are shown. We don’t know how people feel about Palpatine’s return because TROS handwaved a whole other movie.

921,How does Disney-LFL build a new expanded universe without rehashing or scrapping old stories?,13,im60om,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/im60om/how_does_disneylfl_build_a_new_expanded_universe/,2,1599209226.0,"I decided to pick up the new Thrawn book and as I was reading I came across a line where Thrawn mentions the Chiss’s involvement in wars between the Republic and Sith Empire- a direct nod to *The Old Republic* video game and I couldn’t help but wonder what the difference is between the canon and the EU. LFL wiped the entire slate clean, however, that slate was quite full after 37 years and it leaves their new canon in a bind.

One option is to tell completely new stories that differ from the old EU and replace them. However, this runs the risk of angering fans that were invested in those stories for decades. Not only were they told that their stories are irrelevant already, but now they’d be telling decades-long fans that they aren’t even worth anything to LFL. While this would lead to new ideas and stories, the fact that it had to be at the *expense* of something else doesn’t feel like a winning strategy. Jackhammering an existing sub-fandom to make a new one seems pretty dumb and seems to be why LFL is banking on the few unexplored time periods like the High Republic, which limits their overall possibilities.

The alternative is basically retelling the EU stories to appease the existing fandom. However, this would render the original decanonization unnecessary and make it feel like nothing more than a cash grab on LFL’s part. Instead, the solution has been to ignore those explored time periods altogether to put the question aside and just make vague references to it to appease those fans without committing to a full rehash.  

I think most people understood why they wiped the material after ROTJ, but everything else that was wiped feels unnecessary.

This started after I recommended the EU to someone who didn’t like the sequel trilogy.

Me: The post-ROTJ story that the EU told was much better. I recommend them if you haven’t read them.

Him: Yep, it had Leia and Han’s son turning evil and killing half the family but it’s okay because he then gets killed by his own sister. The Empire never really went away and when it’s not the Empire, it’s something else ravaging the galaxy. Palpatine also comes back a bunch of times and the Sith also never really go away.
Totally something people who don’t enjoy the ST would love!

Me: Still way better executed than the sequels were. The OT characters were true to themselves.

Him: I mean, I disagree, but from what I’ve seen some people are not kind to some of the story choices made in the ST and I doubt they’d be onboard with how Legends did almost the same thing but with x10 tragedy befalling the original 3.

Me: At least the original 3 lived longer than in the ST. And the Skywalker family continued to live decades later instead of all dying off only 31 years after Return of the Jedi.

Him: Yes, they’ve lived longer in an almost constant state of war and grief where every weekend someone they loved was getting killed.

Me: Wouldn’t be an exciting story if there was no conflict and consequence.

Him: “I’m okay with them having a life defined by constant tragedy and loss as long as they live long enough to experience some more of it, not like in that wretched trilogy where they achieved a few decades of relative peace and managed to tutor the next generation into keeping the good fight!”

Disney/LF might have changed marketing pieces -- but they didn't change the film in the can (or the film they were actively making ... at least not to that degree).

This trilogy never gave Finn the shot at being the character he could've been.  He's the single most complete and drama-rich character concept -- and they never explore it.  He has an intriguing start, but as soon as he rescues Poe.... he's basically done.

Remember Boyega's was the first face we saw?  Remember all those sweet posters with Finn and the lightsaber.  Yea... they may have reduced him for China -- but let's be honest (and acknowledge Boyega's best point) -- It's even more accurate to say Disney/LF overhyped him and oversold him in Western Marketing (used him for social currency points.)

JJ/KK/Disney/LF -- they knew what movie they had on their hands.

This is Schrodinger’s worldbuilding- there is a different answer for the same event so long as it suits the plot. There is no clear answer, it’s a series of muddled statements that allow the writer the ability to reinterpret the answer when it suits them.

One that always baffles me is that the size of the New Republic doesn’t make sense even when looking at the books. TFA and TLJ claim that the FO could destroy the entire government by destroying one system. Most books say that the NR demilitarized and thus was easily conquered, but some books (most recently Poe Dameron: Free Fall) act like the NR is a sprawling government that couldn’t rule what, “the Empire chose not to.” Yet Bloodlines states that the NR was 1% the size of the old Empire/Republic and many comics act like the NR was kept afloat by allied, independent systems. So what is it? How can the NR be as far-reaching as the Empire while being a fraction of the size of it?

It happens time and time again, like when Kylo Ren apparently didn’t destroy the Jedi Temple in the comics while simultaneously committing or siding in mass genocide or Kylo wanting to live up to Vader while wanting to kill the past even in material before TLJ or the Jedi being a myth until everyone suddenly knows of Vader redemption, but not really.

* Who is Snoke?

Snoke is not a mystery to Han and Leia or at least isn’t treated as a mystery by them and Rey our supposed POV character never treats him as a mystery either.

* Who are the Knights of Ren?

They are only mentioned once in the movie and none of the protagonists treats them as a mystery.

* Why did Ben Solo join the Dark Side?

Leia And Han doesn’t treat this as a mystery either. They only say Snoke got to him and that’s that. How Snoke could be able to do it is never explained.

* How can the First Order have a Death Star ten times bigger than the ones the Empire had when they were suppose to be a small fragment of it?

This isn’t treated as mystery either. Compare this to say Knights of the Old Republic were finding out why the Sith suddenly have a massive fleet is a major plot point of the game.

* Who are Rey’s parents?

Rey never treats WHO her parents are as a mystery only if they were going for return for her.

* How can Rey use the Force without training?

None of the characters in the movie really treats this as a mystery either. Everyone just kinda of accepts that Rey can use abilities that used to take a long time to master under a teacher immediately.

The Anime Fullmetal Alchemist does the whole Mystery boxes very well in comparison:

Why can Ed use alchemy without a circle?  Characters in that anime asks that question and we actually gets an answers eventually.

What are those creepy dark clothed guys that seems to manipulate things behind the scenes? The characters starts to raise that question when they eventually finds out about them. Until then they were mostly a must just to the audience but it works because we actually get to see them in action and that whatever goal they have it involves the protagonist so it’s still effective.

Why did the Protagonist’s dad leave them.

At first we assume that he just abandon them but later we found out that there was more to why he did it and we actually don’t get the full explanation until much later in the anime.

There is probably more mysteries within the anime that i cant think of right now but hopefully you get the point.

Personally, I enjoyed more things about the movie than I disliked about it, but a major disappointment that many people and myself feel is over the death of Ben Solo. I feel that Star Wars would have been much better served if Ben had lived and spent the rest of his life atoning to the galaxy for the many sins he committed in his young life. I also shipped Reylo and was hoping TROS would have ended with a fairy-tale ending of how romantic love went from tearing the galaxy apart (Anakin/Padme) to saving it with Rey and Ben. EU could have covered their lives post-ST, and we can see their stories play out as Ben gets the life that Anakin had dreamed of with Padme. So much potential for the future of Star Wars seemed to have died with Ben on Exegol, along with the end of the Skywalker bloodline. While Rey adopting the name to honor our fallen family is very sweet and poetic, it just seems to keep Ben Solo would have made things so much better.

So let me ask everyone, would your opinion of TROS/ST change if they brought back Ben Solo? It's not unrealistic in terms of the Star Wars universe, as many characters have been brought back from the dead (Palpatine, Maul), and we have the World Between Worlds as a potential gateway for a Benssurection. My opinion of the movie would skyrocket, as his death was the biggest thing I disliked about the movie since he was my favorite character in all of Star Wars. Bringing him back would allow all the potential stories I mentioned earlier to come back as well, and I would love to see it happen.

I know there's plenty of other things people disliked about TROS such as Macguffin chases, Palpatine coming back, and Rey not being a nobody, so maybe it wouldn't make much of a difference to many people. However, I know plenty of people (especially former Reylos) despise the movie for killing him off and there are many who thought he was simply the best character of the ST, and that killing him off was stupid. What do you think?

Although I personally am not the biggest fan of the sequel trilogy, I still like them just because they’re Star Wars! There are scenes in each movie that love and really hit home with me too. I’m so happy that there are people that absolutely adore the movies and especially if you’re a new fan of Star Wars too due to the trilogy! I feel like I’m repeating myself a lot by but seriously I mean what I’m saying. I felt provoked to do this because I have a friend who really wasn’t a big Star Wars fan before, but he really started to get into it by the time The Last Jedi came out and he absolutely fell in love with the universe. Although especially Rise of Skywalker, he started to get hate messages for simply liking the sequels and now almost any mention of Star Wars makes them mad and sad because his experience was tarnished by other people who pushed their beliefs onto them and I’m disappointed that this happened and I hope no one out there is feeling that way. Anyways again I’m so happy there are people that enjoy the sequels and how they brought more fans into our fandom, I just hope you guys and gals are able to just dismiss all the hate and enjoy them. I just hope I didn’t repeat myself all to much and I can guess that there have probably been many messages like this before, but again I wanted to do this for my own reasons. I hope this helps at least someone to smile at least. May the Force be with you! :)

Discussion about diversity in multiple layers has been going on in the  Star Wars community for a pretty long time, which I consider a good  thing. I'm glad that our fellow POC, LGBT and non-male fans have a voice  and are using it to gain more representation in Star Wars as I do  believe representation matters. As someone on the spectrum however it  bothers me that there is no such voice for autistic, or put it more  broadly neurodiverse, people.   
 

Now there has been speculation about several characters who might've  been autistic like C3PO (which would be a bit of a problem on its own),  Anakin Skywalker, Ben Solo and Galen Marek. Though as far as I'm aware  off there has never been a character who has been confirmed to be on the  spectrum, either in universe of through Word of God so, I thought it  might be an idea to have a conversation about this here on this forum.  To get it going here are a couple questions to answer:  
 

Should there be more neurodiverse characters?  
 Should neurodiversity or the different disorders be a thing in-universe?

We have Season 2 of the Mandalorian at the end of this month, which will undoubtedly be great. Squadrons came out last week and is genuinely one of the best pieces of content to be released in the franchise period (which is hilarious to me given that it’s a product of EA), and new films, books, and shows coming out at a rate that hasn’t been seen in about a decade...and the quality of that material is mixed to say the least.

I just don’t know how people have such a bad taste in their mouths still. Whether or not you liked the Rise of Skywalker, it was almost a year ago and already a ton of content has been released since then. Maybe it’s easier for me because the ST is my favorite of the three (hot take, I know), but it feels like a great time to be a Star Wars fan to me.

I mean storytelling style, as in an epic scale show not following a single protagonist or a group of people, but instead exploring the era and following the stories of many different characters, from the sequels, other past media like past shows and trilogies, as well as entirely new characters and stories. I imagine most of it would be set between ROTJ and TFA*

In TLJ, Rian invented the connection between Rey and Kylo purely out of storytelling convenience. He needed them to be connected without being anywhere near each other physically. So, I would, out of pure storytelling convenience, expand this concept for this show. I would like Rey and Ben to interact through the show, but in such a manner that it won't contradict the fact that in TFA, they are apparently unaware of each other. As the show is following in tandem the childhood of Rey and the training of Ben, I would have Rey and Ben meet each other and interact in their dreams. Since most dreams are forgotten, it would be a quick and easy way to explain why in TFA, they don't recognize each other. This dream interaction would be achieved via the dyad in the Force, which predates TFA and by a lot. as Rey actually felt the exact moment when Ben became Kylo Ren. Though she didn't feel it explicitly, she felt it as a cold aura in the air.

1099,Possible use use of some Spanish between Rey and Teedo in The Force Awakens?,6,j7mm3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/j7mm3b/possible_use_use_of_some_spanish_between_rey_and/,4,1602223577.0,"I'm guessing that they mixed a few real languages during their interaction, but I think I there is some Spanish, somewhat modified, used in context. These are just some interpretations.

It begins with what sounds like Teedo saying something to the effect of '(Vayate a) ...tu casa tu!' This translated closely means 'Go to your home you!' or simply 'Go home / mind your own business!""

He then starts muttering as Rey begins freeing BB-8. Part of it sounds a bit like 'Mire! Ah tu casa handar.' It's in inverted grammatically, but it sounds like 'Look! To your house you go!'

Rey says something that sounds like 'No mas!', which means 'No more!' or 'That's enough!' when she suddenly stands up and points at him, ending the the argument.

Teedo responds by saying what sounds like 'Asi es... Asi es!' (always said twice in Spanish too) meaning 'That's how it is... that's how it is.' I've heard this in conversation before, here and there - it's a cool acceptance of a somewhat undesirable situation or undesirable outcome of a situation. A common English equivalent would be ""Oh well, that's the way is.' or 'That's the way the ball bounces.' It's more something that's said by people of earlier generations. Of course, Teedo says it begrudgingly here as he sets off.

Teedo then urges his pack animal to move on, this sounds like 'Ah casa, ah casa! - 'To home!' or 'Let's go home!''

By the way, Teedo always reminds me of the Spanish name or nickname (for junior?) Tito. It's pronounced like Teedo when said in English.",StarWarsCantina,possible use use of some spanish between rey and teedo in the force awakens im guessing that they mixed a few real languages during their interaction but i think i there is some spanish somewhat modified used in context these are just some interpretations begins with what sounds like teedo saying something to the effect of vayate a tu casa tu this translated closely means go to your home you or simply go home  mind your own business then starts muttering as rey begins freeing bb8 part of it sounds a bit like mire ah tu casa handar its in inverted grammatically but it sounds like look to your house you go says something that sounds like no mas which means no more or thats enough when she suddenly stands up and points at him ending the the argument responds by saying what sounds like asi es asi es always said twice in spanish too meaning thats how it is thats how it is ive heard this in conversation before here and there  its a cool acceptance of a somewhat undesirable situation or undesirable outcome of a situation a common english equivalent would be oh well thats the way is or thats the way the ball bounces its more something thats said by people of earlier generations of course teedo says it begrudgingly here as he sets off then urges his pack animal to move on this sounds like ah casa ah casa  to home or lets go home the way teedo always reminds me of the spanish name or nickname for junior tito its pronounced like teedo when said in english,0,1601,281,0,0.051,0.825,0.124,0.9731

1105,My wish/theory for the ending of The Mandalorian.,6,j7brxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/j7brxy/my_wishtheory_for_the_ending_of_the_mandalorian/,5,1602187318.0,"Assuming, that our duo never finds what they are searching for, or decide to stick together regardless I wonder if Din will raise the Child all the way through to the possible adulthood by the time that the show will be over. 

The Child is 50 years old, and if my math is correct (,which it rarely is,) Din would be about 35 years old in the show currently, considering, that he was 10 or so at the time of the Clone Wars. (Then again we weren’t shown any clones in the flashback, so it could as well be a pre-Clone Wars Separatist attack. They may’ve mentioned Clone Wars though, so forgive me if my memory doesn’t hold.)

I don’t remember where it was stated, but apparently Yoda had been training Jedi for 800 years by the time that he died at the age of 900 in The Return of the Jedi.

So that means that once a member of his species reaches the age of 100 or so they are mature enough to become Jedi Masters, so they’ll probably be pretty much adults by then. So that also means, that there’ll be quite a big growth spurt for our boi within the next 50 years. 

Which leaves me to wonder if there is a possibility, that they would end the show with an epilogue where Din at the age of 85 or so shares one last scene with his son. This way they could avoid taking away the cuteness factor of the Child for the main bulk of the show, while giving us an ending for their relationship, that is as sentimental and potent as possible. 

Sadly however, I think that some kind of self sacrificial thing for Din in like 5 in-universe years from now is much more likely. That would just leave their relationship too brief in my opinion, seeing as the Child is still a toddler and with his lifespan losing Din after that short of a time would proportionally be like losing a babysitter that you’ve known for half a year at the age of five. (I know that emotions don’t work that way in SW-universe, but still, once he is at the age of 900 how important character Din would have been in his overall life having known him for such a short while at such a young age.) 

Besides that kind of a sacrificial end would feel really cheap and lazy. I’d hope that Hollywood would’ve learned by now that there are other ways to make people cry and end an arc of a character than the easy “tell my wife and Baby Yoda that I love them” -thing.

Obviously a time jump like that would also result in them having to go to some uncharted times for a bit. About 24 years after where TROS left off. But if the epilogue is strictly about these two characters and their relationship, I don’t think that it’d matter. They could keep it on a specific planet, and that wouldn’t step on the toes of any future writers. I also think that The Mandalorian is such a big priority for Lucasfilm right now, that they wouldn’t mind having it pioneer some things. 

(Mayhaps The Child could also be going to the Rey Skywalker’s force academy for some training after the epilogue.) 

(Haha just kidding...)

(unless..?)

TL;DR:
Din’s and the Child’s ages match so that Din could potentially still be alive and well by the time, that the Child is all grown up, and they could end the show with an epilogue of that.",StarWarsCantina,"my wishtheory for the ending of the mandalorian assuming that our duo never finds what they are searching for or decide to stick together regardless i wonder if din will raise the child all the way through to the possible adulthood by the time that the show will be over  child is 50 years old and if my math is correct which it rarely is din would be about 35 years old in the show currently considering that he was 10 or so at the time of the clone wars then again we weren’t shown any clones in the flashback so it could as well be a preclone wars separatist attack they may’ve mentioned clone wars though so forgive me if my memory doesn’t hold don’t remember where it was stated but apparently yoda had been training jedi for 800 years by the time that he died at the age of 900 in the return of the jedi that means that once a member of his species reaches the age of 100 or so they are mature enough to become jedi masters so they’ll probably be pretty much adults by then so that also means that there’ll be quite a big growth spurt for our boi within the next 50 years  leaves me to wonder if there is a possibility that they would end the show with an epilogue where din at the age of 85 or so shares one last scene with his son this way they could avoid taking away the cuteness factor of the child for the main bulk of the show while giving us an ending for their relationship that is as sentimental and potent as possible  however i think that some kind of self sacrificial thing for din in like 5 inuniverse years from now is much more likely that would just leave their relationship too brief in my opinion seeing as the child is still a toddler and with his lifespan losing din after that short of a time would proportionally be like losing a babysitter that you’ve known for half a year at the age of five i know that emotions don’t work that way in swuniverse but still once he is at the age of 900 how important character din would have been in his overall life having known him for such a short while at such a young age  that kind of a sacrificial end would feel really cheap and lazy i’d hope that hollywood would’ve learned by now that there are other ways to make people cry and end an arc of a character than the easy “tell my wife and baby yoda that i love them” thing a time jump like that would also result in them having to go to some uncharted times for a bit about 24 years after where tros left off but if the epilogue is strictly about these two characters and their relationship i don’t think that it’d matter they could keep it on a specific planet and that wouldn’t step on the toes of any future writers i also think that the mandalorian is such a big priority for lucasfilm right now that they wouldn’t mind having it pioneer some things  the child could also be going to the rey skywalker’s force academy for some training after the epilogue  just kidding

Personally, in Rebels when Ahsoka and Ezra are playing in space and time and she says ""You can't save your master, and I can't save mine.""

1151,The ST's portrayal of the Force Dyad is superior to the PT's portrayal of the Chosen One,3,j5vjt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/j5vjt8/the_sts_portrayal_of_the_force_dyad_is_superior/,11,1601973919.0,"The Prequel movies did a very poor job in making portraying the Chosen One in a positive or interesting light. We keep hearing about how Anakin is the Chosen One because of his high midi-chlorian count, and he was going to bring balance to the force, but what the PT showed was being the Chosen One means all your powers and skills are going to be used for mass murder. In AOTC, Anakin killed an entire village in AOTC and he took part in the genocide of the Jedi in ROTS. His arc in the PT seems to be going from innocent boy to village murderer and finally to mass murderer in ROTS when he kills a bunch of younglings, attacks multiple Jedi, kills the entire Separatist leadership, and nearly chokes his wife to death. Not to mention as Vader, he keeps killing people left and right in both the movies and the expanded universe. Even his redemption had him kill his master, so why would any reasonable person relate to and want to the Chosen One if the Force just wants to use you as a conduit for mass murder?

Compare this to what the ST shows about the Force Dyad. Right in TFA, the dyad allows Rey and Kylo to form a bond that not only allows Rey to quickly connect with the Force, but she was also able to adopt some of his Force knowledge and powers from it. Then, TLJ shows that their connection had evolved into a full Force Bond. While we had seen Force Bonds in Legends, I do not recall the Bond allowing the two Force users to naturally see each other across distances and directly communicate with one another. Usually, Bonds allow the users to sense each other’s thoughts and feelings, but this level of connection was unprecedented in Star Wars. In TROS, Kylo and Rey were able to transport their surroundings and objects across space, the power of the dyad was able to bring Palpatine to full strength, and just being near each other allowed them to do things they could not do alone. Examples of this are taking on both Snoke’s and Palpatine’s guards, the only time Rey seemed to be able to use Force Stasis was against Kylo (which Kylo proved his Force Stasis was much stronger in that same fight), Rey was able to connect with the Jedi and Ben was able to Force Heal to save Rey from death. The Force Dyad is not just about fighting and killing your enemies –which it can still do obviously- but it’s about connection, life, and transcending the limitations of the natural world.

Partly due to the fact that the story of Star Wars has been written and rewritten the course of several decades. 

But it’s something that I’ve been wondering about for a while now. Especially in light of arguments over Kylo Ren’s crimes and Ben Solo’s culpability. 

The way I had always seen it was something akin to a drug addiction. 

Somebody that gets addicted to crack is more liable to do dangerous or violent actions, towards themselves or others. This is based on the substance they consume and how it interacts with the chemicals in their brain. And their own personal choices as well. 

At the end of the day no one can force an addict to go clean. You can give them the facts, you can cut contact, you can stop giving them money, you can show them how their actions are damaging their families etc. But *they* have to make the choice to get clean. They have to want it. 

That was my understanding with the dark side. It makes it easier for a person to commit atrocities, but the decision to make those choices has to come from within.

So if Kylo Ren decides to blow up an entire planet and murder a bunch of innocent villagers and killed his father. That’s on Ben Solo’s hands as well.

The same thing applies to Anakin Skywalker. His hands are just as bloody as Darth Vader‘s. The lives of his wife, his master, small children, and the planet Alderaan are on his as well. 

What about you guys!

I thought it was time to share my ideas on how to improve Star Wars, the ST and the Rise of Skywalker, and I hope to find an audience here. I am just doing this to share my imagination with you, and to hear your thoughts and ideas. I acknowledge that I, like many others, am inspired by the many fan theories and ideas on the improvement on TROS. It is great to fantasize together about fiction you love!

**Introduction** 

I have been a long time Star Wars fan. As a teenager, I enjoyed both the OT and the PT - while recognizing their flaws (clumsy acting in the PT and a rushed plot! And a second Death Star in the RotJ, how unoriginal!). When the ST was announced, I was excited! At the same time I was a bit sceptical: I mean, why would there be a need for a Sequel Trilogy, from a artistic point of view.

**Opinion on the ST** 

I really enjoyed TFA! The film didn't give a proper explanation about why we where there to begin with, but the film was filled with action, nostalgia and mystery. My love for Star Wars took a flight. In my opinion, TLJ was even better. The intertwining character acrs of Rey, Luke en Kylo Ren were great, and I was impressed with the deconstructionist take on the Jedi Order. I thought we would finally get an artistic justification for why the sequel trilogy was there to begin with. A new order, to make things right and to bring balance to the Force.

When TROS came out, I enjoyed it. The movie has it's great moments. But I didn't love it, like I did it's two predecessors. The movie is rushed, and, most of all, many plot elements felt like they where thrown in at the last minute, and weren't given any narrative or creative explanation. Why is Palpatine back in this movie? Why does he need to be there? Why haven't we heard of a dyad before? What's that whole thing about balance? And; why is there a need for a sequel trilogy? 

I can see how TROS fits in the sequel trilogy itself (as a closing third chapter for both Rey and Ren), but I fail to see how TROS is the final conclusion of an nine part space opera. So I asked myself, how can the sequel trilogy be improved? I think just a 'small' addition is needed

**Improving TROS** 

In my opinion, one abandoned plot twist of Episode III is all it takes to justify Palpatine's presence in the movie, to explain why there is a ST to begin with and to give the saga the epic closure it deserved: and that's the revelation that Palpatine was responsible for Anakin's Virgin Birth. With this, Palpatine becomes (indirectly) responsible for the creation of both Rey and Kylo Ren. Or at least the creation of their bloodlines. It also ties the sequel trilogy to the prequels, by referring to the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis and to the fact that Anakin has no father. 

Furthermore, we need to add a few more things in our imagined story line: 

\- Why did Palpatine create Anakin in the first place? That one is simple, he wants a perfect body, extremely strong with the Force. He needs said body for his spirit to host, in case of his inevitable death. This is the 'power to cheat death', and he has mastered it. The fact that he is looking for a host body is of course an already existing plot element of TROS: in order to achieve immortality, he needs to find a new, stronger body, because his own, cloned one is decaying. 

\- We need to understand that Palpatine has been planning to take over Anakin's body from the very beginning, all the way back to 10 years before the Phantom Menace. 

Hence his interest in the young Jedi. ""Lord Vader will become stronger than either of us"", as he says to Yoda, fits into this. 

\- After Vader gets injured, Vaders body isn't a real option anymore. He plans to take over Luke, as we have seen in episodes V and VI. 

\- After being thrown down the Death Star shaft, he is looking for an alternative: the bloodline of Skywalker isn't fail safe since both Anakin en Luke rejected him. He starts making his own clones, and, as we know, Rey is the offspring of one. He hopes that bodies after his own image are more likely to host him. The clones failed, but over the course of the sequel trilogy he starts to gain interest in Rey, his natural offspring. He also remains interested in Kylo Ren's body, as a descendent of his first creation Anakin. That's why he trains him through his puppet Snoke, to make sure that Kylo Ren completes his training and fully succumbs to the power of the Dark Side.

With this addition, the plot of TROS centers around both descendents of Palpatine and their struggle against each other, against their dark origins and against their creator to take over their bodies. The story goes back to the very beginning of Star Wars, making the Skywalker Saga one continuous story. But it does more: 

\- the stakes get higher: the final chapter of the story focuses on preventing evil incarnate to achieve immortality 

\- the fact that Rey and Ren are a Dyad in the Force (where did that came from??) makes a lot more sense now: both of them are related in a way and are extremely powerful. Maybe we should think of the Dyad as a reaction of the Force itself to counterbalance Palpatine's dark magic and misuse of the Force. Ironic, Palpatine's attempts to gain unlimited power makes Mother Nature turn on him, by giving his descendants the combined strength to defeat him once and for all. Balance. 

\- Balance in the Force makes a lot more sense now: Rey and Ren are two halves that are one. Furthermore, all Skywalkers are responsible for balancing the Force, as they are all able to reject Palpatine in the end. 

\- Anakins sacrifice is honored: in the end, he is able to overthrow Palpatine. That proves that you can be whoever you want, despite your dark origins. It proves that Anakins power to love is greater than anything. This also ties up nicely with the point they were making with Rey being a Palpatine but choosing to be a Skywalker. The circle is now complete...

What do you think about this? Since I am not to only one to come up with this idea, I am actually quite shocked that the filmmakers didn't came up with this themselves. A voice in the back of my head is hoping for a Special Edition in a few years time that adds things like this to the movie, but I realize it's a fools hope. 

Thanks for reading this far!

justification for why the sequel trilogy was there to begin with a new order to make things right and to bring balance to the force tros came out i enjoyed it the movie has its great moments but i didnt love it like i did its two predecessors the movie is rushed and most of all many plot elements felt like they where thrown in at the last minute and werent given any narrative or creative explanation why is palpatine back in this movie why does he need to be there why havent we heard of a dyad before whats that whole thing about balance and why is there a need for a sequel trilogy  can see how tros fits in the sequel trilogy itself as a closing third chapter for both rey and ren but i fail to see how tros is the final conclusion of an nine part space opera so i asked myself how can the sequel trilogy be improved i think just a small addition is needed tros  my opinion one abandoned plot twist of episode iii is all it takes to justify palpatines presence in the movie to explain why there is a st to begin with and to give the saga the epic closure it deserved and thats the revelation that palpatine was responsible for anakins virgin birth with this palpatine becomes indirectly responsible for the creation of both rey and kylo ren or at least the creation of their bloodlines it also ties the sequel trilogy to the prequels by referring to the tragedy of darth plagueis and to the fact that anakin has no father  we need to add a few more things in our imagined story line  why did palpatine create anakin in the first place that one is simple he wants a perfect body extremely strong with the force he needs said body for his spirit to host in case of his inevitable death this is the power to cheat death and he has mastered it the fact that he is looking for a host body is of course an already existing plot element of tros in order to achieve immortality he needs to find a new stronger body because his own cloned one is decaying  we need to understand that palpatine has been planning to take over anakins body from the very beginning all the way back to 10 years before the phantom menace  his interest in the young jedi lord vader will become stronger than either of us as he says to yoda fits into this  after vader gets injured vaders body isnt a real option anymore he plans to take over luke as we have seen in episodes v and vi  after being thrown down the death star shaft he is looking for an alternative the bloodline of skywalker isnt fail safe since both anakin en luke rejected him he starts making his own clones and as we know rey is the offspring of one he hopes that bodies after his own image are more likely to host him the clones failed but over the course of the sequel trilogy he starts to gain interest in rey his natural offspring he also remains interested in kylo rens body as a descendent of his first creation anakin thats why he trains him through his puppet snoke to make sure that kylo ren completes his training and fully succumbs to the power of the dark side this addition the plot of tros centers around both descendents of palpatine and their struggle against each other against their dark origins and against their creator to take over their bodies the story goes back to the very beginning of star wars making the skywalker saga one continuous story but it does more  the stakes get higher the final chapter of the story focuses on preventing evil incarnate to achieve immortality  the fact that rey and ren are a dyad in the force where did that came from makes a lot more sense now both of them are related in a way and are extremely powerful maybe we should think of the dyad as a reaction of the force itself to counterbalance palpatines dark magic and misuse of the force ironic palpatines attempts to gain unlimited power makes mother nature turn on him by giving his descendants the combined strength to defeat him once and for all balance  balance in the force makes a lot more sense now rey and ren are two halves that are one furthermore all skywalkers are responsible for balancing the force as they are all able to reject palpatine in the end  anakins sacrifice is honored in the end he is able to overthrow palpatine that proves that you can be whoever you want despite your dark origins it proves that anakins power to love is greater than anything this also ties up nicely with the point they were making with rey being a palpatine but choosing to be a skywalker the circle is now complete do you think about this since i am not to only one to come up with this idea i am actually quite shocked that the filmmakers didnt came up with this themselves a voice in the back of my head is hoping for a special edition in a few years time that adds things like this to the movie but i realize its a fools hope  for reading this far  in my imagination i would add another tank to the cloning facility on exegol maybe one with several clones of a certain gungan just the sight of it would have made audiences gasp,0,6622,1226,0,0.082,0.756,0.161,0.9989

Outside of the common complaint that the Resistance is the Rebellion 2.0, there are also criticisms on how the Resistance shouldn't be named that because it sounds like they're opposing the regime in power: The New Republic. I disagree, and even though this seems like a dumb semantic issue, I would like to address it to highlight the subtle historical differences that inspired the events of the Sequel Trilogy, and how they affect current and future stories. 

Rebellion (an act of violent or open resistance to an established government or ruler): The distinction of an ""established government or ruler"" is important, because it means it is a matter of legality. The Empire is the legal successor to the Galactic Republic, and the Rebels are fighting solely to restore it to its previous state. Ergo, that is why they are also known as the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In accordance with this political tradition, the New Republic is the legal successor to the Empire once the Galactic Concordance was signed into law.  

Resistance (a secret organization opposing authority, especially in an occupied country): While the Empire was a legal entity, the First Order is a foreign menace from the Unknown Regions. Even if the FO shares the Empire's aesthetic and has former Imperial personal, the New Republic is still the legal successor to the Empire. The fact that the FO had to seize control by blowing up the NR capital and initiating a Blitzkrieg war across the galaxy, shows how they are invading upstarts and thugs. The formation of the Resistance was initially to oppose the potential threat of the FO and convince the NR to take the danger seriously, and then they became the main form of opposition once the FO became the de facto governing body. Unlike the Rebellion which wants to oppose the legal ruler, the Resistance is fighting to throw out an invader and to bring back their legal government. 

So, what does this distinction mean for future books/shows/comics when it comes to the stories about the Sequel Trilogy? It looks like the time between TLJ and TROS is going to mirror occupied Europe in WW2. While the Rebel Alliance was based on Vietnamese insurgents waging guerilla warfare, the Resistance is based on the French Marquis of WW2 and other movements opposing the Nazis in Poland, Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and even in Germany itself. We’re going to see a lot more Kijimi situations, and our heroes are going to face potential enemies in the form of FO sympathizers, radicals, opportunists, and collaborators. We’ve seen some of this in the Poe Dameron comics and Resistance Reborn touches on FO work camps, further highlighting the parallels with the Nazis.",StarWarsCantina,the difference between a resistance and a rebellion while not too common i do see posts ripping on the naming of the resistance outside of the common complaint that the resistance is the rebellion 20 there are also criticisms on how the resistance shouldnt be named that because it sounds like theyre opposing the regime in power the new republic i disagree and even though this seems like a dumb semantic issue i would like to address it to highlight the subtle historical differences that inspired the events of the sequel trilogy and how they affect current and future stories  an act of violent or open resistance to an established government or ruler the distinction of an established government or ruler is important because it means it is a matter of legality the empire is the legal successor to the galactic republic and the rebels are fighting solely to restore it to its previous state ergo that is why they are also known as the alliance to restore the republic in accordance with this political tradition the new republic is the legal successor to the empire once the galactic concordance was signed into law   a secret organization opposing authority especially in an occupied country while the empire was a legal entity the first order is a foreign menace from the unknown regions even if the fo shares the empires aesthetic and has former imperial personal the new republic is still the legal successor to the empire the fact that the fo had to seize control by blowing up the nr capital and initiating a blitzkrieg war across the galaxy shows how they are invading upstarts and thugs the formation of the resistance was initially to oppose the potential threat of the fo and convince the nr to take the danger seriously and then they became the main form of opposition once the fo became the de facto governing body unlike the rebellion which wants to oppose the legal ruler the resistance is fighting to throw out an invader and to bring back their legal government  what does this distinction mean for future booksshowscomics when it comes to the stories about the sequel trilogy it looks like the time between tlj and tros is going to mirror occupied europe in ww2 while the rebel alliance was based on vietnamese insurgents waging guerilla warfare the resistance is based on the french marquis of ww2 and other movements opposing the nazis in poland netherlands the soviet union and even in germany itself we’re going to see a lot more kijimi situations and our heroes are going to face potential enemies in the form of fo sympathizers radicals opportunists and collaborators we’ve seen some of this in the poe dameron comics and resistance reborn touches on fo work camps further highlighting the parallels with the nazis,0,2827,475,0,0.095,0.812,0.092,-0.8225

Ben Solo. Ben flipping Solo. I remember when I first watched TFA back in 2015 and I initially liked Kylo because 1) He is the son of Han and Leia and is the grandson of Darth Vader and 2) He looks and acts cool (though the tantrum bits were really funny). However, if I said that was why he is great now it would be a massive disservice to the character. Ben Solo is my all time favorite Star Wars character and I realized this when I re-watched TLJ last year, specifically the Throne Room scene with Kylo, Rey and Snoke. Ben Solo, in my opinion, is the most tragic character in all of Star Wars (even more so than Vader) and I think is what Anakin SHOULD have been in the Prequels. This post is designed to break down the early life of Ben Solo from his perspective. The sources I will include in this part are:

&#x200B;

* **The Sequel Trilogy (Obviously)**
* **The Rise of Kylo Ren**
* **Wookiepedia (Don't have any of the film novels and haven't read everything about him so sorry about that.)**
* **Aftermath Trilogy**
* **Star Wars: Bloodline**

Strap yourselves in folks this is gonna be a long one.

The story of Ben Solo begins on the planet of Chandrila in Hanna City in 5 ABY on the day that the Galactic Civil War officially ended thanks to the Galactic Concordance signed between the former Galactic Empire and the rising New Republic. However, while young Solo was in his mother's womb, Leia described him as a a living band of light that frequently dimmed and was thrust through with a vein of darkness. While of course this could be a foreshadow to Kylo's internal conflict in the ST, I believe it could also refer to Luke (the living band of light) and Palpatine (vein of darkness). As Ben Solo said himself during his duel with Tai on the Minemoon of Mimban, ""The dark side and light both claimed me for their own the moment I was born. Do you know how that feels?""

Even Ben Solo's name is a massive problem, he is named after legends: Jedi Master Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi who served in the old Republic, and his father Han Solo who was a general during his time with the Rebellion. This puts huge amount of pressure on him as he felt that everyone expected to be as great and heroic as Obi-Wan despite never meeting him and Han's surname isn't even real, it is a lie. ""Everything is a lie!""

https://preview.redd.it/kemzkdbzyvq51.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f9240601d7912ab01bcb13403133237ac6d354

Already these two things will evolve to be massive problems for the boy, as he will be struggling with the weight of the expectations of the galaxy on his shoulders.

The problems with the Solo family continue to increase. Initially the family relationship was going pretty good, with Leia being with him when he said his first word and took his first steps and with Han, despite lacking the force bond that his son and his wife had (which could also be a reason why Ben chose not to shoot down his mother in TLJ), who is son often followed him while playing with his gold dice. It was also going well with Chewbacca who taught him how to shoot a blaster and fly a speeder. However, this will turn its ugly head as his parents often had to leave him in the care of nursing droids due to their busy lives (Leia as a senator and Han who couldn't stay in one place for too long) and this would leave Ben with feelings of abandonment and making him doubt that his parents loved him. In fact, he believed that his parents thought of him as some sort of monster because of their conversations about him when he used the force during his tantrums. This would enhance even more when they decide to send him off to his uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker at the age of 10 years old. Now this was a logical decision, but this made things even worse. Not only did it solidify in Ben's mind that his parents hated him but also that they stripped him a choice on what he wanted to be. Ben never wanted to be a Jedi, maybe he wanted to be a Senator like his mother or an amazing pilot like his father or whatever he wanted to be. But now all of those doors are closed and he is left with nothing but loneliness and anger. At least with Anakin he was encouraged by his mother and its always what he wanted to be. Ben Solo on the other hand never got any of that. This is implied further with this panel (plus the fact that Leia ""sent"" him to Luke as she said in TFA):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bkfekjm0zvq51.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=a26b8a70c4bf2bf4725c2ef48515fd4bd6820cf1

However, he has someone he could share these feelings with. Someone who he could trust, Snoke. He is the one of two people who could possibly understand him and he feels. The other one is a fellow student of Luke's Jedi Academy: Tai.

At this moment, Tai is Ben's best friend and tells him that he shouldn't be afraid of who he is. He may be the child of legends but he must be himself. And for a while, things might not be so bad.

All of that changes during his last year as Luke's apprentice.

During the elections on who is becoming the First Senator of the New Republic, it is revealed that his mother is the daughter of Darth Vader and thus he is the grandson of the Sith Lord. How did he find out? We don't know but I think Ben found out on the Holonet or via Snoke which would have increased his anger towards his family even more. Not only do they hate him but they don't trust him. However, he doesn't turn to the dark side. Maybe he is being irrational. His family does love him. They didn't intentionally try to hurt him. They love Ben Solo and nothing will change that.

One night he hears the sound of an ignited lightsaber...and turns.

https://preview.redd.it/t8syeoo1zvq51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2d3bc35886fa5db04d953a461c44a54aeb455f0

His uncle tried to murder him. This is the last straw for Ben. His family thinks he is a monster and must die. He defends himself and brings his hut down, killing his master. WHY? WHY? WHY WOULD THEY TREAT HIM LIKE THIS? A red cloud appears, and the temple explodes.

https://preview.redd.it/7uhv3cv3zvq51.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b3104dd598550face2e7461f044a16a48d929fe

Horrified of what just happened, he runs and tries to save any of the students but is thrown back by the flames, he never wanted this. But he never chose it, The Jedi did. Skywalker. The cause of the explosion is ambiguous but I think the close up on Ben's eyes is meant to be a hint that he unintentionally destroyed the temple with the dark side. After all, fear (of his near death) leads to anger (towards his family, anger leads to hate (towards his uncle), hate leads to suffering (the deaths of Luke's students.) Even if it wasn't him, he still felt as if it was his fault which is why he tells Rey that he destroyed Luke's temple. I have seen some people annoyed that Ben didn't kill all the students himself. Ben Solo and Anakin Skywalker are two different people. It will be extremely out of character for him if he casually committed Order 66 again on the temple just because of his uncle and plus people would just complain that they are rehashing the Prequels so really its a lose-lose situation apparently. Anyway, Ben Solo is confronted by Voe, Hennix and Tai and despite telling the truth, they don't listen to him. Just like his biological family, his Jedi family don't trust him. This whole scenario is designed so Ben would have nowhere else to go but to Snoke. After escaping the students in which he really injured Hennix by accident (and is initially terrified on what he just did.), he heads of to Snoke and tells him that he is thinking of joining the Knights of Ren who he met with his uncle and Lor San Tekka in a High Republic era Jedi Treasure Trove on the planet Elphorna. This is where they discuss Ben's imagined name if he joined the knights that he thought of as a child: ""Kylo"". Despite Ben believing it's stupid, Snoke tells him that *""Children's thoughts are pure. They do not practice self-deception. They are who they are. And when you called yourself by that new name, you saw your truth. It represents what you want to do on a deeper level. The part of yourself you want to cut away"".* ""Kylo"" is clearly the combination of ""S**ky**walker and ""So**lo**"" and this suggests that Ben, at this point in his life, wants to reshape the legacy that he hates so much into something of his own. However, it is also a sign how he will never be able to kill the past completely as it will always be with him.

After revisiting Elphorna and being told to meet with the Knight on Vanrak in the Mid Rim, he is confronted once again by his former Jedi allies who engage in a fight. In this battle, Voe chases Ben who calls him a murderer and he must face justice for his crimes. How dare she? She called him a murderer despite Luke being the one who tried to end him while he was sleeping? The rage in Ben temporarily consumes him as he shouts at Voe. If she wants him to be a murderer, so be it. He force pushes her off the platform but, like his uncle in TLJ, immediately regrets his decision and tries to prevent her fall. Unfortunately, Hennix just sees the push and, like Ben did in the hut, assumed that the worse has just happened. He throws his lightsaber, trying to kill the monster once and for all, but Ben deflects it and in the process, accidentally kills the old friend. He shoves his former allies into the old treasure trove and collapses the entrance, trapping them inside. It's over, finally. He travels to Vanrak, telling the Knights of Ren that he killed a Jedi and that he can join them. However, the Knights are unimpressed. Once again Ben Solo feels that he is not good enough and that he is alone. Still he is allowed to travel with them to see if he is worthy. He must be worthy, he will be worthy.

And now we are at the place that will ensure the young man's path to darkness...for now:

The Minemoon of Mimban.

It is here where Ben Solo really sees the harshness of reality. For most of his life he was in luxury with his parents and at peace and tranquility with his uncle at the Jedi Temple. The Knights give the young man a massive wake up call. He is in the real galaxy now, and this is shown when Ben grabs the information of the location of an artifact they are looking for in the mind of a prisoner, using a variation of the Jedi mind trick. Ren is impressed by his actions and he ""releases"" the prisoners...by killing them all. Ben is shocked. This is his life now, a life full of darkness. If Ren pressuring the young man wasn't enough, his former allies Voe and Tai show up in which Ben duels with the latter. This is where it has all been leading to. Tai pleads with his friend, telling him that it is not too late to go back., that he has a choice!

A choice? Choice? Ben Solo never had a choice, his own name wasn't one. The dark side and light both claimed him as soon as he was born, in the form of Luke and Snoke (and secretly Palpatine). No-one sees him as a person, just expectations and a legacy. Despite Tais pleas, he is bested. But Ben hesitates...maybe he can turn away. As Tai tells him, *""Be the man I know you are.""*

And in a blink of an eye, Tai's neck is snapped...and he falls to the ground. The only Jedi who understood Ben Solo...is dead. Solo walks off and looks back with a sad and regretful expression on his face (seriously that look hurts my soul).

https://preview.redd.it/am9piv55zvq51.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec15584938bfee044a4baad2d5bce4c0b79e1fd

Ren was the one who killed Tai. His best friend. The Knight accuses Ben, telling him that he is ""fighting this every step of the way"". Ben grabs Tai's lightsaber and the duel begins. Ren confidently tells Ben that because he is no-one, he could do anything he wants. However the young man reveals that while other people thinks he is special, he doesn't...which means he can also do whatever he wants. This turning point is sensed across the entire galaxy:

*""Yes, my boy...yes.""*

*""Ben...oh no...Ben.""*

*""Huh. You feel that? Feels...cold.""*

*""Yes. Yes. Claim your birthright and strike him down.""*

And after a long struggle, Ben Solo gives Ren his good death.

He has finally done it. There is no turning back now. He is a murderer, like Voe called him, which is what he tells her before killing her in cold blood, asking her why she even wants to live. The Knights of Ren are finally his to command. But there is one thing that needs to be done. Ben Solo takes his blue crystal, pouring all of his fear, anger and hate into it, and flashes of all the people in the past show up: Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, Lando and Tai. He can't do it..there is still conflict in him. The crystal cracks, a physical representation of his conflict and failure to let go of the past. A voice calls out to him ""What is your name?""

Be more like the last jedi/ The Alien Franchise don't be afraid to try new things be bold don't be safe.

https://youtu.be/SsRNUkMe8v4

I've been thinking a lot about the future of Star Wars in the lead up to the Mandalorian season 2. It seems that the Disney+ / Live Action shows may represent an extension of the Filoni-verse, which is great! But the future of Star Wars on the big screen is in question.

To answer the question of where Star Wars goes next, we must first look to the past.

After the release of Revenge of the Sith in 2005, George Lucas described the story of Star Wars as the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker. The six films together told a complete story of Anakin’s rise, fall, and redemption, placing him at the center of the narrative. Anakin is designated as the chosen one meant to bring Balance to the Force, fulfilling a long held Jedi prophecy. This task for which Anakin was uniquely qualified seems to be complete when the Emperor is destroyed and the Galaxy is redeemed.

Yet we know George Lucas, at the time he sold Lucasfilm to Disney, had written stories for a sequel trilogy of films focusing on the original trilogy heroes and the grandchildren of Darth Vader. So the question must be asked, what story remains to be told after the Force has been balanced? The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker were not based on those original drafts, so they don’t provide a clear picture of Lucas vision for the concluding chapter of Star Wars. If we can extrapolate a potential narrative and thematic trajectory for the story building from the balance achieved at the end of Return of the Jedi, we can then compare Lucas vision to the sequel trilogy as it exists presently, and then determine the best course forward for the Star Wars saga.

To understand the narrative and thematic arc of Star Wars, as imagined by George Lucas, we need to begin with an understanding of what is meant by Balance of the Force.

There exists in the Star Wars Galaxy a prophecy of one who is meant to bring Balance to the Force. George Lucas made clear his intent that Anakin Skywalker, later turned Darth Vader, was, as believed by Qui-Gon Jinn, in fact the Chosen One meant to fulfill this prophecy.

Though Luke Skywalker is the hero of the Original Star Wars trilogy, his character arc culminates in the redemption of his father, rather than the destruction of the primordial evil force in the story, Darth Sidious, or the Emperor.

Anakin was ultimately responsible for the destruction of both the Jedi and the Sith. George Lucas has confirmed that, regardless of his fall from grace and Luke taking up the mantle of hero, Anakin did not loose his designated role as the Chosen One, meant to bring Balance to the Force.

Yet the question remains: What does Balance of the Force means?

For the first part of this discussion, I’ll be focusing primarily on the prequel and original trilogies. For better or worse, the sequel trilogy as it exists was not part of George Lucas original vision for Star Wars. As Dave Filoni has said in interviews and commentary, George Lucas should be seen as the arbiter of anything related to the deeper lore and mythology of Star Wars, particularly in relation to the Force.

Perhaps if we can answer the question of what Balance of the Force means in the mythology of Star Wars as imagined by Lucas, we can better understand the manner in which the sequel trilogy fits narratively and thematically as a continuation of what was once a complete six film saga.

George Lucas based the mythology in Star Wars largely upon the Monomyth or the Hero’s Journey as outlined by Joseph Campbell in ‘The Hero With a Thousand Faces.’ Campbell was himself influenced by the work of Carl Jung, who proposed the existence of archetypal forces which emerge from the collective unconscious. These archetypes are ancient patterns of personality, distinct from the individual unconscious described by Sigmund Freud. They, manifest in the real world, taking different shapes or forms when filtered through the subjective lens of the individual.

Joseph Campbell’s writings on comparative mythology describe the emergence of these archetypal personas through myths, folklore, and religious stories from around the world. Campbell described the universal patterns and character types seen in the stories told in disparate societies across time as a manifestation of innate primal psychological forces. Though the names and faces vary, the forms are surprisingly constant. Campbell likened these archetypal characters to masks picked up and worn by individuals by whom they are manifest and given life.

George Lucas constructed the mythology of Star Wars by distilling these powerful universal motifs. The Force may be likened to the collective unconscious, a substratum underlying physical reality which both emerges from and gives rise to individual organic life.

The primary characters in Star Wars are modern variations of the archetypal forms including the hero, the mentor, and the shadow. We see these characters exchange masks at various stages in their lives. Notably, Anakin Skywalker, a representationn of the hero in the prequel trilogy, later dons the mask of the shadow through an experience of death and rebirth as Darth Vader. Jung described the archetypes as inherited potentials which take different shapes when actualized through the thoughts and behaviors of an individual. The Dark Side of the Force itself may thus be described as a representation universal ‘shadow’ archetype.

The 'shadow' is an inextricable aspect of an individual psyche. It is the archetypal persona with the potential to do evil things. Every person has a shadow. Jung wrote of 'confronting and synthesizing the shadow', meaning evil is unrealized potential that exists within the individual. To confront and synthesize the shadow is to recognize one's weaknesses, the paths that could lead one to act upon those ideas and manifest the 'shadow' archetype in the world. Darth Vader always existed as a potential within Anakin, which was actualized when he chose to put on the mask of the shadow.

George, in various interviews, has simplified the dichotomy between the light and dark sides of the Force as representations of compassion and selfishness respectively. So what then is meant by balance? An equal devotion to or manifestation of both good and evil, light and dark? At the end of the original six film saga, both the Jedi and Sith have been destroyed so many have speculated that total devotion to the light side of the Force was the primary flaw of the Jedi as was total devotion to the Dark Side a flaw of the Sith. But this interpretation would have no basis in any real world moral or ethic. It would imply that total devotion to good, to compassion, is a moral evil, a notion which is not reflected in any of our religious or mythological stories.

There are no ‘Grey Jedi’; Anakin balances the Force, not by embracing or blending the ideals of both the Jedi and the Emperor, but by wholly rejecting the Dark Side. The original trilogy concludes with the Return of the Jedi, the return of the light; achieving balance. Luke Skywalker and his sister Leia Organa remain to rebuild a New Jedi Order after the fall of The Empire.

But wait, what about the fall of the Jedi order? In the path to achieving Balance, thousands of Jedi were also killed. Weren’t they servants to the Light Side of the Force? Why was the Jedi Order destroyed? Was this the ‘Will of the Force’? Often we see in our religious stories, purgation of the religious institutions after they have been corrupted and deviated from their original mandate. The Jedi were devoted to the Light Side of the Force, but that does not mean their decisions and actions were morally aligned with the light.

Returning to Jung, if we consider ‘the shadow’, the Dark Side of the Force, to be an inextricable aspect of any individual or institution, it cannot be eliminated because it exists within all beings, as a byproduct of free will. The collective unconscious is an inherited trait. Call it original sin, passed down from primordial forebears. As long as good is a choice, evil is a possibility. This means that the light must continually confront and synthesize the shadow, the dark side – not by integrating and acting upon those ideas or desires, but by recognizing their existence, keeping them in check, and actively choosing not to manifest the dark side in the material world.

When balance is achieved, neither light nor dark ceases to exist. The light must be actualized, and the dark must remain unrealized potential, the byproduct of choice. To 'eliminate' the dark side, is to eliminate free will, freedom to choose the light, and thus the individual no longer has agency - and becomes an automaton. Imbalance.

I think there's evidence for this understanding - in the final arc of Clone Wars season 6, Yoda's journey leads him to a place where he confronts his shadow (visually represented as an evil form of Yoda), and overcomes his own darkness. Even Yoda has this dark seed within himself which has the potential to grow and emerge through thought and action if it remains unrecognized and it is only through recognition of that evil that resides in himself that he is able to attain the path to 'immortality'. Prior to this revelation and confrontation, Yoda believed himself to be devoid of, separate from the Dark Side. The shadow within himself was unrecognized.

You could apply this to the Jedi Order as a whole. Anakin is the dark potential, the shadow, of the Jedi Order, which the council fails to recognize. The Jedi serve the light, but don't realize the cracks in the foundation which ultimately allow Anakin's turn to Darth Vader. Qui-Gon (not surprisingly the first Jedi seen in the story to attain the path to becoming a Force Ghost, instructing Yoda from beyond the grave), is likely the one Jedi who could have prevented Anakin's fall. Qui-Gon was the father figure absent in Anakin’s life. That role was later vacated by Qui-Gon’s death at the hands of Darth Maul, and later filled by Chancellor Palpatine. Qui-Gon’s instruction to Obi-Wan in the opening scene of The Phantom Menace to obey the will of the Living Force signals his role as a prophet like figure to the Jedi Order. Yet the Jedi Council failed to head his words which served as herald for their impending destruction.

The Order had become rigid, too strongly set in tradition, to adapt to new ideas (evidenced by their initial refusal to train Anakin because he was 'too old', despite the fact that he very well could be the 'chosen one', which introduces a sort of Pharisaical allusion). They had too closely aligned themselves politically with the Republic and thus served as Generals rather than Peace Keepers during the Clone Wars. Evil commanded both armies, yet the Jedi chose a side. Neutrality was the only path that could have averted Sidious trap. All of these factors play directly into the events which result in Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, the destruction of the Jedi Order, and the fall of the Republic. Essentially, there existed an imbalance in the Force. The Jedi's vision is clouded by the Dark Side - because their ideology has fallen out of alignment with the Light Side of the Force. They attributed this lack of foresight to some external shroud, failing to recognize that the dark potentia within their own ranks in the form of Anakin Skywalker, whose fall was in part precipitated by their own corruption.

Palpatine’s machinations were indeed a very real threat whose identity as the puppet master orchestrating the events of the Clone Wars remained elusive as a result of the Jedi Council’s clouded vision. The Jedi’s inability to recognize this evil Force in such close proximity The Jedi may be understood to mean the Force was not speaking to them because they weren’t truly listening. The Jedi of the Old Republic, prior to Darth Bane’s creation of the Rule of Two, fought to vanquish an external evil Force. For a thousand years, the Jedi believed they had succeeded in eradicating this external force of evil. Just like war, peace is a snare. Over time, their alignment with the light side of the Force drifted. In bright sunlight, high noon, contrast is reduced. The shadows become difficult to see. Only at sunset, the twilight of the republic, as the light fades and the shadows grow deep do they recognize the one they cast, following their own footsteps.

Balance does not mean equal parts light and dark manifest in the world, nor does it mean the eradication of the dark, but the proper orientation of light and dark, where the former is actualized in the world and the dark remains unrealized potential. The only way to maintain balance is to realize that the dark resides within. Any other path leads to imbalance. To view the dark side as something which can be eliminated, as did the Jedi, is externalize it and thus leave the shadow within unchecked, able to metastasize and overtake the light.

Consider that Luke, in his training on Dagobah, enters the Dark Side cave and confronts a vision of Vader, ultimately witnessing his own face behind the mask. He later learns that Vader is his father - thus Luke confronts his own shadow. Vader, the external evil he must confront is his own blood. Thus he must understand and come to terms with the knowledge that the very potential for evil which transformed Anakin Skywalker also exists within himself. Interestingly, this revelation is also what allows Luke to see the light remaining in Vader, inapparent to even Yoda and Sidious, which ultimately brings about Vader's redemption, the defeat of the Emperor, and salvation of the Galaxy. It follows that, if the potential for evil, actualized by Vader resides within Luke, the son, then so too must the good that is in Luke reside within Anakin, the father.

During the final throne room confrontation in Return of the Jedi, Luke casts aside his lightsaber, refusing to strike down Darth Vader in anger. Luke recognizes the shadow in himself, visually represented by his mechanical hand – the first step to becoming more machine than man. In the ultimate act of non-violence, Luke saves the Galaxy, not by destroying Vader, but by refusing to become him. He has no hope of defeating the Emperor. Luke recognizes his inability to destroy the Emperor, the external source of evil, yet understands he retains power over his own choices, the destiny of his own soul. Luke is willing to suffer, sacrificially to preserve that light in himself and thus brings Anakin back from the Dark Side of the Force.

Yoda and Obi-Wan mentored Luke, but failed to see this potential in Vader. Their advice to Luke was flawed. Obi-Wan told Luke that if he refused to kill Vader the Emperor would have already won. Yet, the Emperor failed because of Luke’s refusal to kill Vader.

Anakin ultimately was the instrument by which balance was achieved. He finally synthesized his shadow, Vader, when he saw the suffering of his child at the hands of the Emperor. Anakin, in the last moments of his life, refused the shadow, returned to the light, and defeated the Emperor, the symbolic source of imbalance. The mask of the shadow was at last removed and Anakin was able to look on his son with his own eyes one final time.

Luke and Leia, twins born of a union unsanctioned by the previous Jedi Order, were left at the end of the Saga to rebuild this institution meant to serve the light side of the Force. Luke did not reject the teachings of Obi-Wan and Yoda wholesale. He integrated their instruction, but also followed the will of the Living Force, recognizing it was not the will of the light to destroy Vader.

At the end of the six film saga, Balance was achieved and harmony restored to the Galaxy. The shadow of the Jedi Order was confronted and synthesized. Anakin was redeemed and Vader returned to the ethereal plane of the archetypes, unrealized potential.

understands he retains power over his own choices the destiny of his own soul luke is willing to suffer sacrificially to preserve that light in himself and thus brings anakin back from the dark side of the force and obiwan mentored luke but failed to see this potential in vader their advice to luke was flawed obiwan told luke that if he refused to kill vader the emperor would have already won yet the emperor failed because of luke’s refusal to kill vader ultimately was the instrument by which balance was achieved he finally synthesized his shadow vader when he saw the suffering of his child at the hands of the emperor anakin in the last moments of his life refused the shadow returned to the light and defeated the emperor the symbolic source of imbalance the mask of the shadow was at last removed and anakin was able to look on his son with his own eyes one final time and leia twins born of a union unsanctioned by the previous jedi order were left at the end of the saga to rebuild this institution meant to serve the light side of the force luke did not reject the teachings of obiwan and yoda wholesale he integrated their instruction but also followed the will of the living force recognizing it was not the will of the light to destroy vader the end of the six film saga balance was achieved and harmony restored to the galaxy the shadow of the jedi order was confronted and synthesized anakin was redeemed and vader returned to the ethereal plane of the archetypes unrealized potential really interested to hear your thoughts so please let me know what you think balance of the force might mean",0,16188,2765,0,0.114,0.82,0.066,-0.9995

Now I’d heard about the special obviously, I’d read about what an abysmal experience it was in Anthony Daniel’s book, and even seen a few short clips, but this time I decided to watch it, the whole thing- from start to finish. So, last night me and a few friends set up a chat and decided to watch it at the same time (with plenty of drinks). From the outset I was bowled over by just how 70’s everything felt, and of course how poorly made it really was, but when I saw “brought to you by General Motors”- it all made sense. They may as well have said “filmed in crappovision” . I mean I wasn’t expecting gold, but even the “opening scene” with Han and Chewie is just so poorly lit, it was as if they were performing it in a broom closet. I must admit I was excited when I heard that we were getting a performance from Jefferson Starship (high point of the night), and a cameo from Bea Arthur (I am a big Golden Girls fan).  

Right, let’s get this straight- it is shit. There’s no denying that, it’s shitness is destined, written in the stars as absolutely as the opening crawls of all the movies. And even while drinking and making fun of it, it’s quite impressive how it’s shitness manages to shine through. I think my personal low point was the extended scenes of dialogue between the Wookiee characters with no subtitles or human characters. I mean, it’s a brave creative choice, not one I would have had the balls to make. I will admit to actively enjoying some of the more obviously comedic elements. For instance the Harvey Korman moments are a stupid waste of time, but they’re meant to be, it’s just pure silliness, and I will admit I did find myself laughing at the “whip whip stir” moment, just for how agonisingly long it goes on. I also enjoyed Bea Arthur’s musical interlude, yet again it’s silly, but she has a nice voice and it’s quite a nice little scene (also I’d had about 7 beers by that point). 

Honestly the person I feel most sorry for was Carrie Fisher, I think if any of us were told we’d have to warble an almost improvised sounding song with no backing in the middle of a vacuous sound stage, we’d all struggle.  I can see why they formatted this like a variety show, because you really need the animated sequence (yay Boba Fett), and the bizarre Wookiee sex VR (yay insanity) to pad out what is at best like a quarter of a story. But you know what, despite it’s almost legendary status in the fandom, despite all the things working against it- I didn’t hate it, even on its own terms. I can imagine that if I’d been a seven year old kid in 1977 who had seen Star Wars that summer and was so desperate for more that I’d sat in front of the tv that holiday season to watch all my favs interact on screen in a new adventure, I might’ve loved it. It’s bad, but it’s not malicious. And for that reason I can’t hate it. In summary I’d say it’s good, if a bit long, and definitely worth a watch with friends, even if only virtually and while drunk.

I’ve tried playing Jedi Academy and Jedi outcast several times, on Xbox, switch and PC. But I just find the saber combat really weird to control, and I just can’t really get the hang of it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I do like that it actually cuts through enemies, rather than smacking them like in The Force Unleashed or Battlefront. My biggest issue is most games with sabers is that they feel like a baseball bat, not a sword made of plasma.  so being able to just walk into a storm trooper and kill them without swinging is really cool. But when it comes to actually moving and using the saber, I just really don’t like it. 

If I was designing a saber combat system, I’d want it to be a mix of two systems. The first would be Jedi Knight, being able to cut through enemies like butter. But I would want it to control similar to a game like For Honour, which I feel offers a good balance of Control, speed and precision. 

I know literally no one agrees with me on Jedi Knight, but I’d be interested to hear how people feel about my idea for saber combat :)",StarWarsCantina,"this is an incredibly unpopular opinion but i don’t really like the saber combat from the jedi knight games

Now that I've laid out the question, let me give some context. I just recently decided to read the Thrawn series, so I dove into the first book. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I couldn't put it down. There's just something appealing about the idea of Thrawn going to Imperial school, schooling all the officers, and then out performing every military leader while not using a lick of political power in a power hungry system. I thought Vanto was a great sidekick since he was this average guy who was along the ride with the very serious and calculated Thrawn. It was great to watch their relationship develop.

With all that said, I was very excited to pick up book 2. Well, I'm halfway through and this book has been an absolute slog. To start, Anakin is just annoying. The way he's portrayed makes him seem not very intelligent and very boorish. Granted he's a hothead, but usually he's considered a brilliant mind. I really don't see why Thrawn would be impressed with Anakin up to this point outside of his fighting skills, but that doesn't seem like something Thrawn would be impressed of on its own. And while I still enjoy Thrawn as a character, this book just doesn't show off his tactical brilliance like the last one did. He's a pretty mundane character in this one so far and what makes him interesting just hasn't shown much. Lastly, the story is such a bore. Halfway through the book and not much of interest has happened. Thrawn hasn't been impressive like usual and neither has Anakin. I don't feel it has furthered either character.

So without any spoilers, is this book worth finishing? I'm just really having a hard time finishing this one and that's not like me. I read lots of books and rarely ever don't finish them, but this one just isn't capturing my interest which is a shame based on the first book.",StarWarsCantina,thrawn alliances i have a question i need to ask other star wars fans about did anyone else get bored with thrawn alliances that ive laid out the question let me give some context i just recently decided to read the thrawn series so i dove into the first book i absolutely loved it i couldnt put it down theres just something appealing about the idea of thrawn going to imperial school schooling all the officers and then out performing every military leader while not using a lick of political power in a power hungry system i thought vanto was a great sidekick since he was this average guy who was along the ride with the very serious and calculated thrawn it was great to watch their relationship develop all that said i was very excited to pick up book 2 well im halfway through and this book has been an absolute slog to start anakin is just annoying the way hes portrayed makes him seem not very intelligent and very boorish granted hes a hothead but usually hes considered a brilliant mind i really dont see why thrawn would be impressed with anakin up to this point outside of his fighting skills but that doesnt seem like something thrawn would be impressed of on its own and while i still enjoy thrawn as a character this book just doesnt show off his tactical brilliance like the last one did hes a pretty mundane character in this one so far and what makes him interesting just hasnt shown much lastly the story is such a bore halfway through the book and not much of interest has happened thrawn hasnt been impressive like usual and neither has anakin i dont feel it has furthered either character without any spoilers is this book worth finishing im just really having a hard time finishing this one and thats not like me i read lots of books and rarely ever dont finish them but this one just isnt capturing my interest which is a shame based on the first book,0,1948,349,0,0.108,0.77,0.123,0.8947

Here are some reasons why I think Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is the strongest Force user we’ve ever seen on screen. Of course, this is all very subjective and I’m sure many will disagree, but this is my opinion and I hope you enjoy my breakdown.

First of all, two of the most powerful force users in the ST say this about him:

Luke Skywalker: *""I've seen this raw strength only once before in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.""*

Supreme Leader Snoke: *""When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power, and beyond that, something truly special.""*

Also let’s think about the force powers Ben/Kylo displays in the films:

\-In TFA he stops a blaster bolt in mid-air and holds it for over a minute. We’ve never seen a force user do this and it’s something we never see a force user do again. This is one of the most impressive force powers I’ve ever seen in any Star Wars film, hands down.

\-In TLJ he is able to mask his true intentions in the force from a being as strong as Snoke, when he turns and ignites the Skywalker saber, killing his master. This is something Luke couldn't even do aboard the DS2 with his lightsaber right beside Palpatine. Also by killing his dark side master, he did something Darth Vader couldn’t even do.

\-In TROS he is the only force user we ever see to completely bring someone back to life (Rey). Her body was lifeless on Exegol which isn't the same as when she healed his wound on Kef Bir. This ability could've been attributed to the Dyad, but it's worth pointing out, nonetheless. It’s also an ability his grandfather Anakin would have been envious of when trying to save his wife Padme.

\-In TROS he somehow survives being thrown down (what looks like) a bottomless pit by the most powerful Sith Lord ever. We don’t see on screen how he is able to get back up, but my guess would be he used some type of force levitation to keep himself from falling to his death (which was something he accomplished when training with Snoke in the “Age of Resistance: Snoke” comic book) .

\-In TROS he is also the first to rise against a rejuvenated Palpatine after both he and Rey’s life forces were drained.

I think these are all worthy points as to why Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is the most powerful force user in the Skywalker Saga. He may not be the flashiest fighter (like Anakin), but the abilities he displays are second to none and completely unique to him and for that I give him the edge over his grandfather.",StarWarsCantina,"why ben solokylo ren is the strongest force user imho

I believe that because if some of the building backlash JJ actually held back on touching upon things from earlier in the saga. 

One of the things what I was expecting and feel was a real missed opportunity was the plot line surrounding C-3P0 and his memory. 

My initial guess after the first trailer was that he would need to have his memory wiped because something inside him that Anakin would have placed there would need to be retrieved. Later when it was clear that it would be his memory that was taken I felt it would have been great to have R2 upload his memory back but include everything from the moment Anakin first turned him on.

Star Wars is awesome! I've just been preparing myself for season 2 of The Mandalorian by consuming as much Star Wars media as I can, including the films, but also more of the expanded universe(both canon and legends'). So I have been going deep into some of the comics, including Vader Purge, Age of the Republic/rebellion/resistance, etc. Or reading a few SW books (I read the original Thrawn trilogy from the EU, as well as the new canon Thrawn trilogy, and plan to add the Aftermath trilogy and Bloodline to that list!). I am excited by the idea of a novel trilogy covering the period betweenthe OT and the PT to fill me up on the cold war between the first order and the new republic in the lead up to force awakens. 

And for the first time ever, I am watching the Clone Wars animated series. I never got around to this, but I am happy i am finally investing time into it, because it really is a blast. It captures that episodic, space opera epic that the movies always were about, while also expanding the universe/characters in interesting ways. I am not a big fan of the prequel movies, but the clone wars series improves on a lot of things that i was annoyed with by the prequels, and makes me appreciate it all more in the grand scheme of the greater saga! 

Now, I am eager to also start SW Rebels, and then Resistance, while also reading some of the other comics I missed out on (namely, Rise of Kylo Ren). Then, of course, i will also have to rewatch season 1 of the mandalorian. To top it all off, I am also replaying Star Wars Battlefront 2(for the space battles and feel of blaster combat) and Jedi Fallen Order(for  the in-depth Jedi knight experience!) 

Seeing this giant universe, built over the course of decades through mediums of tv, film, animation, gaming, literature, comics is really amazing, and gives me such an appreciation for the overall themes of inter-generational trauma/conflicts, legacy, spirituality, friendship, the darkness within ourselves, and cool space shit blowing up!! And I just love the look and feel of this crazy universe. 

With such eccentric and varied antagonists ranging from Boba Fett, to General Grievous, to Darth Maul, to  Jabba the Hutt, to Grand Admiral Thrawn, to Darth Vader, to Hux, to Kylo Ren, to Emperor Palpatine and great charming heroes like Padme, ObiWan, Luke and Anakin Skywalker, Ben Solo, Han Solo, Rey and so much more!

This universe is amazing. I love Star Wars. I love this franchise, and I love my fellow fans! I love you people too! All of us, our different knacks and tastes , all united in an appreciation for a mythology that appeals to the inner child and teen in all of us, no matter how demographics, that is awesome.

Thank you all for your interest. If Star Wars did not have such a big fanbase composed of all of you individuals, it might have been forgotten into obscurity,  and we never would have gotten all the thrilling stories that call to our inner adventurers.

1381,Why the Sequel Trilogy matters so much to me.,53,izip44,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/izip44/why_the_sequel_trilogy_matters_so_much_to_me/,13,1601066426.0,"Let me just say up front that this is my opinion and nothing more. Feel free to disagree with me but please be kind enough to not be rude in the comments. Civility is all I ask for. That goes for everyone.

I did not have a normal introduction to star wars. I was born in 2000. So I never saw any of the prequels in cinemas. I was introduced to star wars when I saw a family friend play a cool shooting game with robots and guys in white and blue armour. I asked to play and loved it. I asked what the game was about and they showed me Revenge of the sith. 

Oddly enough I didnt instantly fall in love with star wars. I was more focused on other things I liked at the time like Sonic, Spiderman and Avatar. It wasn't until 2015 that I ever thought about star wars again. It was late into August and I heard people saying a new star wars movie was coming out. I thought they were just joking and looked it up online. To my absolute shock at the time it was true. I then told my dad and said I had to see. Mostly because it was a star wars movie and how can any self loathing 15 year old nerd not go see the new star wars movie.

I went into the theatre with my dad and had an absolute blast. Ot was the first time my dad and I had gotten to see a star wars movie together in the theatre. I still have the r2d2 popcorn bucket to this day. After seeing that movie I went back and watched all the other star wars movies, Clone Wars and just got hooked on the whole series. The Force Awakens is what made me a star wars fan.

In the time between TFA and TLJ I had been watching a bunch of videos about Athiests debunking Silly internet Christians because I was an edgy teen and that made me feel smart. By 2017 things had changed. Instead of talking about religion the youtubers I watched started to pivot towards debunking feminism. To my great shame I just followed thier talking points and never questioned them. This led me into following more and more morally dubious people. My teen angst turned into a resentment for everyone around me and I became a horrible little asshole. I was actively cheering for trump despite living in Australia because I thought it would trigger the snowflakes. Then Last Jedi happened.

I loved the movie. I found Luke more interesting then ever. I thought Finn was fun and Poe had a really moving arc about leadership. I loved the whole movie and didnt have any real complaints. Then I went onto YouTube and saw that all the youtubers I followed hated the movie. I just couldnt understand why. I listened to all there arguements and I just couldnt why. It was at that moment I realised that these people who I thought were the smartest people alive could be wrong about something. That led me to start to question everything they ever told me and resulted in me abandoning that entire side of the internet.

I few months later my grandmother died. She fell in the shower and was bleeding internally. Before she died I promised to her that I would make her proud. I had never cried so much in my life. Ever since then my life was totally aimless. I had just graduated and was looking for a job for two years straight. I got two callbacks but never hired. I thought there was something wrong with me. I felt totally worthless and that everything was going to hell. I was just drifting through life. 

When TROS came out I saw a man find faith in a higher power, an arrogant hot shot become a leader. A angry and scared man redeem himself and a lost girl find her purpose and family. I had never smiled so much at a movie before. It was the first movie I saw twice in theatres and I loved it even more the second time.

These movies are not perfect. They have many flaws and I will admit them. But they are never enough to make me dislike them. They are my star wars and they helped me fall in love with this franchise and helped me through the worst times in my life. They inspired me to try and create stories that could help make others feel as happy as the sequels did for me. I am now 6 months into Film School and working hard to become a writer/director and producer.

1394,A (possible) thematic conflict in the STAR WARS saga.,10,iz6vwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iz6vwm/a_possible_thematic_conflict_in_the_star_wars_saga/,14,1601013751.0,"So, I responded to a thread earlier, just saying nice things about Yoda and Luke at the tree in *The Last Jedi*, and two people started arguing about the whole question of Jedi coming from anywhere vs. Jedi having inherited power. It's a common argument, so I'm not dragging on anyone.

But for what it's worth, I think this hits on a problematic issue with the *Star Wars* flicks in general.

[Note that I'm discussing the movies, not any external media.]

I think there's an inherent conflict in the messaging of *Star Wars* as it pertains to the Force and the ability of people to use it.

Basically, there's the idea of the Force as something unbound to specific people, where anybody can use it. This is the tack Lucas took in 1981, when he said that it was like yoga, accessible to all, it seems to be what the original film was setting up (because Lucas didn't know at the time that Luke ""inherited"" his Force strength from Vader), and it seems to be what Rian Johnson was setting up with *The Last Jedi*. This idea seems to draw most from *Eastern religion concepts* like chi and tao, which are Forces that, per Obi-Wan, permeates everybody. (Something the new *Mulan* misunderstands by suggesting Mulan has a certain ""amount"" of chi.)

But there's also the idea of the Force as something dynastic and inherited, a Force that in a way ""plays favorites."" It isn't just that Luke gets his power from Vader. It's that Leia gets her power from Vader. That Kylo gets his power from Leia (and from Vader). That Vader gets his power from a virgin birth supported by the evidence of an overabundance of midi-chlorians. And now that Rey got her power because it is literally ""his power"" (i.e. Palpatine's power). This part of the story seems influenced by *Western dynastic oral storytelling*. There's the obvious King Arthur connection, but there's also the secret godlike parentage of Greek and Roman mythic heroes (Theseus, Perseus).

I think this represents an inherent contradiction in messaging. It basically feels like the *Animal Farm* quote, ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."" Which is a lie.

Now, you can definitely argue that Obi-Wan and other Jedi are not evidenced as having Force-strong parents, etc. That the fact that the Skywalkers have this powerful bloodline doesn't mean that everyone does. And so therefore people who say the Force is just an inherited thing aren't recognizing the full scope of how it functions.

I get that angle, and it's not lacking for supporting evidence.

However, I think that's a punt. The challenge here is on a core level: the story we are watching in the saga is one dominated by the actions of the Skywalkers and now the Palpatines. And as much as you can have thematic alternatives at the periphery, the *core drama* of the saga rests on two dueling families who are special because of the blood they carry.

It's something I'm not thrilled by with the saga, and the best way I can reconcile it is by distancing myself and recognizing that any saga that tries to combine its influences into such a diverse pastiche (American Western, WWII movie, Arthurian legend, Japanese samurai, etc.) is going to necessarily import ideas that will be in conflict. That helps a bit. And I still love much of the movies.

However, I don't think you can handwave this by saying, ""Obi-Wan had nobody parents, so this isn't a problem."" The Force cannot be simultaneously dynastic and equal-access.

But to quote T1J, that's just me doe. What do you think?",StarWarsCantina,a possible thematic conflict in the star wars saga so i responded to a thread earlier just saying nice things about yoda and luke at the tree in the last jedi and two people started arguing about the whole question of jedi coming from anywhere vs jedi having inherited power its a common argument so im not dragging on anyone for what its worth i think this hits on a problematic issue with the star wars flicks in general that im discussing the movies not any external media think theres an inherent conflict in the messaging of star wars as it pertains to the force and the ability of people to use it theres the idea of the force as something unbound to specific people where anybody can use it this is the tack lucas took in 1981 when he said that it was like yoga accessible to all it seems to be what the original film was setting up because lucas didnt know at the time that luke inherited his force strength from vader and it seems to be what rian johnson was setting up with the last jedi this idea seems to draw most from eastern religion concepts like chi and tao which are forces that per obiwan permeates everybody something the new mulan misunderstands by suggesting mulan has a certain amount of chi theres also the idea of the force as something dynastic and inherited a force that in a way plays favorites it isnt just that luke gets his power from vader its that leia gets her power from vader that kylo gets his power from leia and from vader that vader gets his power from a virgin birth supported by the evidence of an overabundance of midichlorians and now that rey got her power because it is literally his power ie palpatines power this part of the story seems influenced by western dynastic oral storytelling theres the obvious king arthur connection but theres also the secret godlike parentage of greek and roman mythic heroes theseus perseus think this represents an inherent contradiction in messaging it basically feels like the animal farm quote all animals are equal but some are more equal than others which is a lie you can definitely argue that obiwan and other jedi are not evidenced as having forcestrong parents etc that the fact that the skywalkers have this powerful bloodline doesnt mean that everyone does and so therefore people who say the force is just an inherited thing arent recognizing the full scope of how it functions get that angle and its not lacking for supporting evidence i think thats a punt the challenge here is on a core level the story we are watching in the saga is one dominated by the actions of the skywalkers and now the palpatines and as much as you can have thematic alternatives at the periphery the core drama of the saga rests on two dueling families who are special because of the blood they carry something im not thrilled by with the saga and the best way i can reconcile it is by distancing myself and recognizing that any saga that tries to combine its influences into such a diverse pastiche american western wwii movie arthurian legend japanese samurai etc is going to necessarily import ideas that will be in conflict that helps a bit and i still love much of the movies i dont think you can handwave this by saying obiwan had nobody parents so this isnt a problem the force cannot be simultaneously dynastic and equalaccess to quote t1j thats just me doe what do you think,0,3570,619,0,0.043,0.875,0.081,0.9763

The color schemes and lighting were absolutely phenomenal.

They weren’t just beautiful, they enhanced the story. TFA was a constant dual between Blue and Red, a classic Star Wars trope. They were saying “We’re back. It’s Star Wars again”. Then TLJ was red. Like almost the whole time. It was showing how sometimes, the story gets darker than you think. It was also about confronting the darkness within. And then ROS was blue for most the time, showing that good prevails. 

Definitely a plus for the sequels.

Kind of inspired by the format of the first 150 pages (that's all I've gotten through so far) of Sometimes a Great Notion by Ken Kesey. Every shot from the saga is included and I tried to be conservative with my editing. Also John Williams makes it really tough to get too crazy with the editing. He's all over the place. Major changes include seeing the events of the second half of ROTS (after Obi-Wan has his final conversation with Anakin and leaves for Utapau) first from Obi-Wan/Yoda/Bail's perspective, and then later through Anakin's perspective. The Last Jedi is edited so that Rey's time on Ahch-To happens earlier in relation to the story of the D'Qar evacuation and flows directly out of the end of TFA. The podrace and all of Qui-Gon's experiences on Tatooine now happen in the dark recesses of C3PO's mind in the nanosecond that his memory gets erased in ROS. Relative dates are included in the alien dialogue subtitle file (eg. 34 years earlier, 10 years later, etc) the first time we transition to a new time period. Oh yeah, and I used the 2004 special editions for the OT because Jedi Rocks rocks. Fight me.

Included below is the full plot outline:

>!The Star Wars!<

>!So we start with the beginning of Episode 7, opening crawl and all. Poe and Finn meet and share their hijinks and then Finn and Rey meet and share their hijinks and eventually end up on the Millenium Falcon where they get boarded by Han Solo who wants to kick them off until Finn tells Han that BB-8 is ""carrying a map to luke skywalker."" Han stops and lets the name sink in and we fade to the beginning of Episode 4.!<

>!Episode 4 starts and Leia's ship gets boarded by Vader, the droids escape and make their way to Obi Wan with Luke. As Obi Wan starts to tell luke that he ""was once a jedi knight the same as your father"" we fade into Old Ben's memories and Episode 1 begins.!<

>!We follow Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon through their negotiations and to Naboo where they grab Padme and leave for the beach. When they arrive at Tatooine Obi-Wan stays with the ship and Qui-Gon leaves for town so now we only see Obi-Wan's point of view from the ship. A few cryptic comlink conversations later Qui-Gon shows up with some special kid and Darth Maul chasing them. The rest of Episode 1 plays out as usual but Obi-Wan doesn't bother to remember the parade on Naboo. Instead, we fade from Qui-Gon's funeral to 10 years later as Padme and her entourage approach Courascant in their ships at the start of Episode 2.!<

>!Padme gets assigned Obi-Wan and Anakin as her bouncers and as they ride the elevator up to her apartment Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he needs to chill out and relax and anakin says ""I haven't seen her in ten years, master"" as both recall the parade on Naboo ten years prior (fade to episode 1 parade scene). Lil Ani smiles at Padme. Padme smiles back. R2 gives a  ""are you fucking kidding me"" whistle. Obi-Want just looks disturbed and uncomfortable. Frog king holds the orb over his head and we jump back to Obi-Wan and Anakin in the elevator. Obi-Wan turns away from lil Ani and shakes his head. The rest of Episode 2 plays out. Begun the clone war has. Anakin and Padme get married and we fade back into Luke and Old Ben chatting on Tattoine.!<

>!Obi-Wan convinces Luke to leave Tatooine with him and they meet Han and Chewie. As the falcon hits lightspeed and Han departs on his grand life-changing adventure we come back to him 34 years later talking with Rey and Finn as he admits about Luke Skywalker: ""yeah, I knew him"". Random fight on the Falcon and they all escape together. Hux informs Snoke that Starkiller Base is ready and Snoke informs Kylo Ren that the droid they're looking for is in the hands of his father, who we now know is Han Solo. We fade back into Episode 4 as Tarkin blows up Alderaan. The rest of Episode 4 plays. Luke blows up the Death Star. Han is a good guy now. Award ceremony scene fades into Episode 7, the Falcon flying through hyperspace. BB-8 projects the map to Luke Skywalker as a hologram and Han begins to tell Rey and Finn more about Luke and how he lost his way after an apprentice turned against him.!<

>!We fade into the beginning of Episode 5 and let it play the whole way through because it's just awesome. Luke goes to Dagobah, fights Vader, and learns he is his father. Now things are starting to come together and we know Anakin is Luke's Father and Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son.!<

>!We fade back into Han telling Rey and Finn about Luke and about the truth of the force. They get to Maz's Castle. There's a scene where Kylo Ren calls Darth Vader ""Grandfather"" so now we know who everybody is except we're not sure exactly who Kylo's mother is. There must be another Skywalker? Whaaaaaaat?? Back at Maz's Castle Leia arrives and has an awkward conversation with Han. Han tells her ""I saw our son. He was here."" and as Han and Leia gaze into each others' eyes we fade to the beginning of Episode 6.!<

>!We watch as Leia and Luke spearhead the mission to rescue Han from Jabba's palace and then Luke goes to Dagobah to ask Yoda if Vader is really his father. Yoda dies and as Luke's about to leave Obi-Wan shows up! Luke asks Obi-Wan why he played him like that. As Obi-Wan begins to tell Luke about his decision to train Anakin we fade into his memory of Episode 3.!<

>!We see the events of Episode 3 as a whole until Obi-Wan leaves for Utapau. After his final goodbye with Anakin we only see the scenes that Obi-Wan, Yoda, or Bail Organa experienced. The killing of Grievous, Obi-Wan and Yoda's order 66 scenes, Bail arriving at the temple, picking up Obi-Wan and Yoda, the temple investigation, declaration of the formation of The Empire, Obi-Wan's visit with padme, and then the duels, Luke and Leia birth, and hiding of the twins. As Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru look off into the binary sunset with their step-bro's baby the man they don't know just handed them we fade back into Obi-Wan sadly telling Luke of his failure to train Anakin.!<

>!Obi-Wan tells Luke that Leia's his sis and then Luke heads to Endor with Leia and Han. Ewok Shenanigans happen. Luke tells Leia she's his sister and that he's going to go kill their father and Leia is upset. Han comes out and for some reason gets upset too and then Leia tells him to hold her and as he puts his arms around her we fade back to old Han and Leia outside Maz's Castle talking about their son. The rest of Episode 7 plays out, they blow up Starkiller Base and Rey heads out to find Luke.!<

>!As Rey extends her hand offering Luke his old lightsaber back and the camera spins around wildly we transition into that same moment in Episode 8 as she walks forward and hands it to him. We play out her time on Ahch-To until Chewie breaks down the door to Luke's hut and Luke asks ""where's Han?"" We then cut to the beginning of Episode 8 and the evacuation of D'Qar. They escape but Hux says they're on ""the end of a string."" Finn wakes up and asks ""where's Rey?"" Cut back to Rey telling Luke of the dire circumstances with the First Order and asking for his help. We continue on with the Ahch-To storyline cut slightly ahead of its original placement in relation to the rest of the movie until the two threads meet in the space battle/throne room stuff. After what's left of The Resistance escapes from Crait aboard The Millenium Falcon we dissolve from a shot of it flying through hyperspace to the opening of episode 9, two years later.!<

>!We watch episode 9 and the search for Exegol up until C3PO has his memory wiped on Kijimi. As Babu-Frik completes the operation 3PO has a moment of recollection of his baby years on Tatooine. We now see Qui-Gon's experience on Tatooine meeting Anakin and the podrace. As Anakin walks away from his mother the memories fade to black and 3PO jolts back to a new conciousness. Episode 9 continues through the rescue of Chewie until Kylo and Rey are standing in the hanger of the First Order ship and tells her ""you are a palpatine"" as her face fades into the unfinished death star hanging over Endor in Episode 6.!<

>!Episode 6 continues as Luke gives himself up to Vader. The Rebel assault on the shield generator begins and Luke is taken to Palpatine's throne room. As the Emperor makes his classic dark side pitch we go back and forth between Episode 6 and Anakin's point of view from Episode 3. He tells Mace that Palpatine is the Sith lord. He changes his mind, becomes Darth Vader, and kills the younglings. We also see the rest of Order 66. Then Anakin tells Padme it's all going to be ok and fucks off to a volcano where he murders a bunch more people. Flashes of Padme arriving and the duel and then he is saved by Palps and we see him getting surgery and his suit. As he stands by the window of Palpatine's ship watching the early stages of the death star construction we return to Luke watching the battle over Endor. The emperor tells Luke ""you, like your father, are now mine."" We watch almost the rest of Episode 6 up to the point where Luke burns his fathers' remains on Endor.!<

>!We dissolve from Luke's campfire back to Kylo Ren explaining to Rey ""my mother was the daughter of Vader. Your father was the son of the Emperor."" Rey says no thanks and yeets out to the Millenium Falcon. Kylo changes his mind about everything. They throw the Emperor down another hole in Exegol and begin celebrating. Maz hands Chewie a medal and he finds himself remembering the celebrations on Endor after they had killed Palpatine the first time......!<

>!We come back to Episode 9 to finish the celebrations and return to Tatooine with Rey to bury the Skywalkers lightsabers.!<

Thoughts? Would you have spliced it up any differently? Also, if anyone actually wants to see this thing, I'm open to suggestions on how to safely and anonymously share this 26 GB monstrosity.",StarWarsCantina,cantina patrons i humbly present to you the star wars a 195 hr continuous cut of the skywalker saga using the st as the framing device and showing the rest of the story through a series of flashbacks after about 30 hours of rendering my creation is alive kind of inspired by the format of the first 150 pages thats all ive gotten through so far of sometimes a great notion by ken kesey every shot from the saga is included and i tried to be conservative with my editing also john williams makes it really tough to get too crazy with the editing hes all over the place major changes include seeing the events of the second half of rots after obiwan has his final conversation with anakin and leaves for utapau first from obiwanyodabails perspective and then later through anakins perspective the last jedi is edited so that reys time on ahchto happens earlier in relation to the story of the dqar evacuation and flows directly out of the end of tfa the podrace and all of quigons experiences on tatooine now happen in the dark recesses of c3pos mind in the nanosecond that his memory gets erased in ros relative dates are included in the alien dialogue subtitle file eg 34 years earlier 10 years later etc the first time we transition to a new time period oh yeah and i used the 2004 special editions for the ot because jedi rocks rocks fight me below is the full plot outline star wars we start with the beginning of episode 7 opening

So I asked and was given [this link](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder). I started to watch it a while ago, but got distracted by other things and only watched the first episode listed. 

Well, tonight, I decided to get back to it and began the second episode on the list. I'm half-way through and am SO CONFUSED! I have no idea who ""Ventris"" is that Obi-Wan (is that really Ewan MacGregor or someone doing an impression?) and Anakin fighting. I have no idea who any of these Clone officers are.  I don't care that ""Slick"" is the traitor! I don't know who he is! There is obviously supposed to be some emotional stakes at play here (I think), but none of it means anything to me. 

I feel like I'm coming in, you know, SIXTEEN EPISODES into a season. How is this ""chronological?!"" It doesn't make sense. I'm hopelessly lost watching this episode SECOND! If you can't tell, this is very frustrating. I want to watch this, but I'm so confused.

I don't think that I should have to know backstory (beyond the films) or read other books or comics or compendiums or SW dictionaries, etc. to figure out what is going on to make sense of this ""chronological"" order. What is the right way to watch *The Clone Wars* and have it, you know, make sense without having to watch YouTube videos to explain stuff, or read Wookiepedia entries, or other supplementary material to, yeah, make it make sense?

1463,"My ""what if"" on had Ahsoka told the council what Maul revealed to her",19,ix2e7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/ix2e7d/my_what_if_on_had_ahsoka_told_the_council_what/,3,1600730272.0,"I posted this to a comment section on a YT video and it has gotten a couple hundred likes so far. Basically I think the point of no return in SW is when Maul revealed to Ahsoka Sidious' plans in the last season of The Clone Wars and she didn't divulge this information to the Council, thus preventing them from saving Anakin. 

Anyway here it goes:  


Ahsoka tells Yoda and the other Jedi what Maul knows about Anakin: That he will be the new Sith apprentice. The Jedi however feel this is a trick by Maul and disregard it until Anakin tells Mace Windu who Palpatine is. Instead of confronting the Chancellor, Mace  summons a meeting with Anakin, Ahsoka, and the rest of the Council. Maul is brought before the Jedi via holotape and reveals all he knows and this all but  angers Anakin. He now knows he was manipulated for years by Palpatine and storms off to confront the Chancellor. Mace and a few other Jedi try to stop Anakin but he knocks them with a blast of Force energy out of anger. Rex tells Yoda what he knows/theorizes about the inhibitor chips. 

Anakin arrives at the Chancellors office and engages his lightsaber, Palpatine lunges at Anakin and the two begin to fight. This battle prevails throughout the office and spills out into the streets of Coruscant, giving Ahsoka and Rex the time they need to arrive on planet as they meet up with Mace Windu. They finally catch up to Anakin who has Palpatine cornered and on his knees, about tho strike the dealing blow. Ahsoka and Mace plead with Anakin to spare him as this is not the Jedi way but with little luck, Ahsoka jumps in and blocks her master's attack pleading once more to stop. Using this as his opportunity to escape, the Sith Lord then unleashes his Force powers and electrocutes the four of them while he escapes. On the run, he flees to the local command garrison to notify central command that the Jedi are traitors and gives the word to execute Order 66.

With the knowledge passed on by Rex, Yoda makes success in alerting some Jedi in the field, but failed in reaching many of them; he also alerts the Temple which begins an evacuation of the Younglings although several Jedi remain to mount a defense. Obi-Wan defeats Grievous and immediately takes his ship to flee the Clones, rendezvousing with Yoda and other Jedi that received their warnings. At the Jedi Temple, the brave defenders are simply no match for Lord Sidious and are entirely wiped out. The Sith Lord comes across his disgraced apprentice who has been enchained. Just as he is about to strike down the Zabarak, he gives the Maul a final chance for redemption. He tells Maul that he must go to Mustafar, wipe out the Separatist leadership, and give the order to shut down the droids. 

As Obi-Wan is making his journey to reach Yoda he experiences a vision of a burning, volcanic planet with a hooded figure standing over piles of corpses. He sense the raw anger, hate, and fear of this individual and is drawn towards its source.  Rex, Anakin, Ahsoka, and Mace finally awaken but also receive visions of their own with the Jedi Temple burning; they immediately make their way to it and see bodies of clones and Jedi spread throughout the courtyard and the halls of the Temple. They deal with a few Clones left behind and head to the communications room where they are able to make contact with Yoda, Obi-Wan, and the other surviving Jedi. Yoda also brings Bail Organa into the conversation and he informs the Jedi of Palpatine's  emergency Senate session and is working to gather senators to oppose Palpatine. Obi-Wan informs the Jedi that he senses what he fears is Maul on Mustafar and preps to make his journey. Knowing the danger that awaits for the Senators, Anakin leaves to go find Padme. 

Anakin tells Padme all that has transpired  and urges her to flee but she refuses and wants to be at the Senate to stand with Bail. Anakin demands her to leave but she calls in her personal security to have Anakin escorted away.  At the Senate, Palpatine goes through his speech but Bail objects with Rex at his side. The Clone informs the Senators what Palpatine has done and how he engineered the Clone Wars to purge the Jedi and take control over the galaxy. This causes an uproar that Palpatine is unable to control so he acts fast. He orders the Clones to secure the Senate building and to flood the chambers and kill all those that oppose him. Anakin, Ahsoka, and Mace then leap into action to save as many Senators as they can while Anakin confronts Palpatine again. Ahsoka helps Padme  to safety and goes back to rescue more. The Jedi and Sith Lord duel once more throughout the impeding chaos   

On Mustafar, Maul does as he was ordered and awaits further instruction when he sees a ship fly in. He goes out to approach, thinking it is Sidious when Obi-Wan steps out. Shocked, but surprised, Maul takes to this challenge to finally prove he is worthy as a Sith Lord. Obi-Wan wants to bring justice to his former Master and his former love who both died at the hands of Maul.  The two duels occur simultaneously and in the end, both Sith lay  dead. Obi-Wan and Anakin were tempted by the Dark Side but they conquered these emotions and utilized the goodness in them to vanquish the evil. The Senate building is secured as a detachment of Jedi survivors arrive. Padme suddenly goes into labor and she is transported away to a nearby hospital with Anakin alongside her. Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia while she survives childbirth.    

In the aftermath, the Jedi are made aware of Anakin's violation of the Jedi code with his marriage to Padme, but the Purge has humbled the Jedi. They too realize they violated the Jedi Code with their involvement in the Clone Wars and became blinded by the Dark Side. Anakin is given a pardon and Ahsoka once again is given an offer to rejoin, which she does.   

For his bravery, Anakin is granted the rank of Master and given a seat on the Jedi Council   

Luke and Leia become younglings and will be trained as Jedi   Yoda revises the Jedi Code to give more freedom for future generations   

Bail is elected Chancellor and promptly demilitarizes the Republic and recognizes the sovereignty of the Confederacy   

Anakin and Padme begin a new life together on Tatooine where the hate Anakin once had for his homeworld is now gone. Luke and Leia continue their Jedi training. 

19 years later, the Skywalkers are preparing for a trip to the Jedi Temple. In a few days, Luke and Leia will be become Jedi Knights while Ahsoka will be made a Master in a grand ceremony. Padme asks Luke where Leia is as they will be departing in a few hours. Luke tells his mother that last he knew, she went out to Mos Eisely. Leia is seen in the cantina ordering a drink when she is approached by a man who introduces himself as Solo.",StarWarsCantina,"my what if on had ahsoka told the council what maul revealed to her i posted this to a comment section on a yt video and it has gotten a couple hundred likes so far basically i think the point of no return in sw is when maul revealed to ahsoka sidious plans in the last season of the clone wars and she didnt divulge this information to the council thus preventing them from saving anakin  here it goes

1465,Reylo Is Deeper Than We Thought - The Dyad Explained,21,iwu93k,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iwu93k/reylo_is_deeper_than_we_thought_the_dyad_explained/,11,1600694546.0,"  

I have to say, I do find the Dyad to be an interesting addition to the Star Wars universe and to the Force. The explanation of the Dyad is that it is two that are one in the force, so they are akin to a spirit being split into two physical manifestations. So although these two physical avatars were living separate lives, it was inevitable that they would eventually become one again. 

Rey’s rise in Force ability after uniting with her literal other half in TFA and probing each other’s minds, as well as the seesawing of ability we see between the two when they fight sits well with me now, knowing that they’re two sides of the same coin. 

It gives solace to Ben’s end as his passing is just him becoming one with Rey/himself/herself again. Then, 'the one' can manifest as a force ghost after Rey passes. We’re told by George Lucas that the Force ghost takes the form of when they fell, so we can safely assume that the ghost's form will be of Rey. 

Side note: for those wondering what went on when Sidious gained his power back – we’re told that the power of the Dyad is immense (like life itself), so when Reylo is drained by Sidious, he’s just draining/syphoning some of that power to restore himself.

When they become one again we are given their new name – **Rey Skywalker**.

Solo we see Han speaks Shyriiwook. How did he learn? We’re they going to revive the the disused ROTS concept where young Han was on Kashyyyk during the droid attack. When the clones turned perhaps he could have been taken by the empire as war orphan (a solo?) and sold to Lady Proxima.

Casian Andor was a separatist “I've been in this fight since I was six years old. You're not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it” and we all know about Obi Wan and the clone wars.

I would love to see the Star Wars universe in a different era. I think it would be interesting to see the Sith Empire in full flow before the rule of two and not have to be tied into the current era to give the writers a bit more freedom to create something fresh and new.

You could structure the films like the MCU, focusing films on different Jedi, Smugglers, alien cultures and planets. It would also be great to see both sides, having films focusing on Bounty Hunters, Sith, Admirals & Troopers.  Also grey Jedi, Hutts, movies focusing more on pilots and ships etc to mix it up.

Then have the big tie in films that pull all the characters together.

I would love to see this going forward.

1513,Star Wars Music Top 50 Countdown,1,ivk9xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/ivk9xq/star_wars_music_top_50_countdown/,4,1600512300.0,"There are tons of movie rankings posts but how about something a little different to mix up the discussion? Here are my top 50 tracks from the series. Tracks line-up with track titles on Spotify unless otherwise noted, and with one exception I avoided the opening and closing tracks for the movies. For this, I considered all soundtracks from the 11 live-action movies along with Clone Wars, Rebels, Resistance, and The Mandalorian. To be honest, all of these soundtracks are good to great so it's a bit tricky. I don't discuss plot much but I don't hold back if I do. Without further ado:

**50. General Grievous (Revenge of the Sith)** \- At the time kind of a weird extra villain before Clone Wars came out, I think this track emphasizes the large, lumbering figure we meet in Episode III.

**49. Resistance (Resistance)** \- Resistance has the weakest soundtrack IMO, and Tavera rarely gets to shine as a composer, but the main theme is a pretty fun adventure theme! \*Not on Spotify

**48. Dice and Roll (Solo)** \- Our first of many from Powell's excellent Solo score, Dice and Roll covers the Sabaac games with a fun use of guitar.

**47. Dodging Debris (Clone Wars)** \- A lot to choose from in season 7, this is one of my favorite action tracks during the tail end of the final episode.

**46. Rogue One (Rogue One) -** This plays as the crew hijacks the U-Wing and Bodhi gives them their titular call sign. A good momentum building track.

**45. Death of a Master (Clone Wars)** \- Used multiple times throughout CW for, you guessed it, the death of a master. A solid collab between Kiner and guest contributor Takeshi Furukawa.

**44. The Droid Invasion and The Appearance of Darth Maul (The Phantom Menace)** \- Picture the mist in the swamp, with mounted Gungans marching onto the battlefield, and let your inner 9-year-old soar. This covers a bit more than just that but the opening is why I included it.

**43. The Return of the Jedi (Return of the Jedi)** \- The uptempo version of the main theme that plays right as Luke grabs his green lightsaber for the first time by the Sarlaac pit and the battle begins.

**42. Cantina Band (A New Hope) -** It's pretty straightforward, to be honest, but I had to include it.

**41. Burying the Dead (Clone Wars)** \- Heavy on the synths and covering the last couple of moments from a seven-season show, Burying the Dead is a perfect quiet ending. 

**40. Luke and Leia (ROTJ)** \- An oft-overlooked theme perhaps due to people not immediately gravitating towards the sibling reveal, it's pretty good!

**39. The Battle in the Snow (The Empire Strikes Back)** \- Our first ESB track makes rare use of the piano in its opening. Unsurprisingly this shows up in loads of Star Wars video games and is quoted in the Rebels soundtrack as well. 

**38. Padme's Ruminations (ROTS)** \- This mostly choral track plays over the sunset on Coruscant as Anakin stares across to Padme's apartment, debating whether or not to let Mace follow-through with his plan to arrest Palpatine or if that will indirectly end Padme's life.

**37. The Adventures of Han (Solo)** \- The only Solo track composed by Williams, it's a fun, swashbuckling theme for our more youthful version of the famous smuggler.

**36. It's Over Now (Rebels)** \- The end music to the rather cinematic Season 2 finale, It's Over Now quotes Asokha's theme well among others.

**35. The Mandalorian (The Mandalorian)** \- I had a hard time knowing what to do with Goransson's excellent Mandalorian score due to the lack of individual tracks I gravitated towards. Not so for the iconic theme that plays on 7 of the 8 credits. I give a lot of credit for remixing the sound of Star Wars while still making it feel at home.

**34. The Battle of Crait (The Last Jedi)** \- A really fun mishmash of themes both new and really quite old (a top-three use of ""Here They Come"" is buried in here). 

**33. Jyn Erso & Hope Suite (Rogue One)** \- A sampling of Jyn-centric music used throughout the movie.

**32. Finn's Confession (The Force Awakens)** \- Occurs as Finn admits to Rey in Maz's Castle that he is a Stormtrooper with no real interest in the Resistance. A pretty, string-heavy piece. 

**31. Ahch-To Island (TLJ)** \- The excellent Jedi Steps and Rey's Themes bookend a mysterious theme covering Luke's troubled daily routine.

**30. Victory and Death (Clone Wars)** \- The intro to the final episode sums up the situation pretty well. Order 66 is in effect and Asokha's own company is cutting through a door with the intent to kill her.

**29. The Mandalorian - Orchestral Version (The Mandalorian)** \- Plays of the credits of Episode 7 after the Child's capture. It's a slow-building but sharp remix of the original.

**28. The Imperial Suite (Rogue One)** \- Among other things, invents a new sound for the Empire which totally fits with the cues set by Williams in the pre-Imperial March A New Hope soundtrack.

**27. Your Father Would Be Proud (Rogue One)** \- A rather dramatic piece as Cassian and Jyn simultaneously ponder victory and defeat towards the end of the movie.

**26. Parade of the Ewoks (ROTJ)** \- As a proud pro-Ewok Star Wars fan, I had to include the whimsical theme Williams included for them.

**25. Lando's Closet (Solo)** \- A timeless sounding love theme that evokes Indiana Jones (and Marion), and even older movies for Han and Qi'ra.

**24. The Spark (TLJ)** \- After quoting ""Luke and Leia"" for the final conversation of the Skywalker twins, the piece turns to an epic build-up as Luke does what he said he wouldn't and ""faces down the whole First Order"". 

**23. Torn Apart (TFA)** \- Brilliantly captures the shifting emotions as Kylo Ren ultimately goes through with his decision to kill his father.

**22. Star-Dust (Rogue One)** \- Heavy on the piano, it's a quiet, emotional track that covers both Galen's message to Jyn and the Death Star's attack on Jedha. Honestly reminds me of some of Giacchino's work on Lost.

**21. Marauder's Arrive (Solo)** \- Covering the latter portion of the train heist on Vandor, the women's vocals as the cloud riders arrive really get my adrenaline going. 

**20. Anakin's Theme (TPM)** \- Simultaneously innocent and wondrous, while also hinting at the Imperial March. Brilliant stuff.

**19. Anakin's Betrayal (ROTS)** \- A tragic theme used both during Order 66 and the preamble to Anakin's duel with Obi-Wan. Really captures the fall of everything good the movie is going for.

**18. Reminiscence Therapy (Solo)** \- This track covers the post-Kessel action and is exactly what its title would imply. The themes from the OG Death Star, Here the Come, and the Asteroid Field are intercut with new themes for Han and Chewie.

**17. Into the Trap (ROTJ)** \- The background music for my favorite battle in the series, I can pretty much hum this from memory.

**16. Kylo Ren Arrives at the Battle (TFA)** \- An energetic piece that eventually leads to Kylo Ren's capture of Rey on Takodana, it's my favorite of TFA's intros to the two Kylo Ren leitmotifs. 

**15. The Emperor (ROTJ)** \- Haunting, it's everything little me needed to feel genuinely unsettled by the Emperor. He feels more like a unholy demon than anything else.

**13/14. Battle of the Heroes/Anakin vs. Obi-Wan (ROTS)** \- I'm combining these two as they both capture different stages of the climactic battle. Heavy on the chorals, it's everything you want for what's happening.

**12. Han Solo and the Princess (ESB)** \- The OG love theme, it has a timeless quality that captures the love in the face of adversity vibe the two share through the movie.

**11. Asokha Leaves (Clone Wars)** \- Punctuating the excellent season 5 finale, this track opens with one of my favorite mixes of the force theme before drifting into it's own melody highlighting Asokha's sadness and conflict at leaving the order.

**10. Main Title (Various)** \- Gets me hype every time. You know what this is. \*Not a specific version

**9. The Imperial March (ESB)** \- People somehow forget its completely absent from the original, that's how ubiquitous this has become.

**8. Sabine Suite (Rebels)** \- There aren't official soundtracks for seasons 3/4 as far as I can see, but this is an all-timer (used the YouTube version). Perfectly capture the disgraced warrior vibe of the episode ""Trials of the Darksaber"". 

**7. The Asteroid Field (ESB)** \- My favorite ""action"" piece in the series, enhances the drama of heading into an area that probably should end our heroes.

**6. The Rise of Skywalker (The Rise of Skywalker)** \- If this is indeed the last major theme of John Williams, what an awesome note to end it on. One of two themes that I think could perfectly encapsulate the whole series, this one feels like it could have existed in any decade of movie scores.

**5. Rey's Theme (TFA)** \- The beating heart of all three sequel soundtracks, the use of the ""celeste"" instrument gives it a mix of Williams Star Wars and Williams Harry Potter.

**4. Duel of the Fates (TPM)** \- They held nothing back for this energetic piece covering the duel at the end of the movie. Quoted frequently in unrelated situations throughout the prequel era because this piece was too dope not to.

**3. Princess Leia's Theme (ANH)** \- The true masterpiece of the original soundtrack, even more than the main theme. I dare any new composer to beat it.

**2. Across the Stars (Attack of the Clones)** \- The only Episode II song on this list, but it's a gem. Could easily capture the sense of the whole series.

**1. Yoda's Theme (ESB)** \- Somehow hits me in the feels pretty much no matter what context in which it is played. Captures the wonder I hope future kids feel when exposed to this series.

across to padmes apartment debating whether or not to let mace followthrough with his plan to arrest palpatine or if that will indirectly end padmes life the adventures of han solo  the only solo track composed by williams its a fun swashbuckling theme for our more youthful version of the famous smuggler its over now rebels  the end music to the rather cinematic season 2 finale its over now quotes asokhas theme well among others the mandalorian the mandalorian  i had a hard time knowing what to do with goranssons excellent mandalorian score due to the lack of individual tracks i gravitated towards not so for the iconic theme that plays on 7 of the 8 credits i give a lot of credit for remixing the sound of star wars while still making it feel at home the battle of crait the last jedi  a really fun mishmash of themes both new and really quite old a topthree use of here they come is buried in here  jyn erso  hope suite rogue one  a sampling of jyncentric music used throughout the movie finns confession the force awakens  occurs as finn admits to rey in mazs castle that he is a stormtrooper with no real interest in the resistance a pretty stringheavy piece  ahchto island tlj  the excellent jedi steps and reys themes bookend a mysterious theme covering lukes troubled daily routine victory and death clone wars  the intro to the final episode sums up the situation pretty well order 66 is in effect and asokhas own company is cutting through a door with the intent to kill her the mandalorian  orchestral version the mandalorian  plays of the credits of episode 7 after the childs capture its a slowbuilding but sharp remix of the original the imperial suite rogue one  among other things invents a new sound for the empire which totally fits with the cues set by williams in the preimperial march a new hope soundtrack your father would be proud rogue one  a rather dramatic piece as cassian and jyn simultaneously ponder victory and defeat towards the end of the movie parade of the ewoks rotj  as a proud proewok star wars fan i had to include the whimsical theme williams included for them landos closet solo  a timeless sounding love theme that evokes indiana jones and marion and even older movies for han and qira the spark tlj  after quoting luke and leia for the final conversation of the skywalker twins the piece turns to an epic buildup as luke does what he said he wouldnt and faces down the whole first order  torn apart tfa  brilliantly captures the shifting emotions as kylo ren ultimately goes through with his decision to kill his father stardust rogue one  heavy on the piano its a quiet emotional track that covers both galens message to jyn and the death stars attack on jedha honestly reminds me of some of giacchinos work on lost marauders arrive solo  covering the latter portion of the train heist on vandor the womens vocals as the cloud riders arrive really get my adrenaline going  anakins theme tpm  simultaneously innocent and wondrous while also hinting at the imperial march brilliant stuff anakins betrayal rots  a tragic theme used both during order 66 and the preamble to anakins duel with obiwan really captures the fall of everything good the movie is going for reminiscence therapy solo  this track covers the postkessel action and is exactly what its title would imply the themes from the og death star here the come and the asteroid field are intercut with new themes for han and chewie into the trap rotj  the background music for my favorite battle in the series i can pretty much hum this from memory kylo ren arrives at the battle tfa  an energetic piece that eventually leads to kylo rens capture of rey on takodana its my favorite of tfas intros to the two kylo ren leitmotifs  the emperor rotj  haunting its everything little me needed to feel genuinely unsettled by the emperor he feels more like a unholy demon than anything else battle of the heroesanakin vs obiwan rots  im combining these two as they both capture different stages of the climactic battle heavy on the chorals its everything you want for whats happening han solo and the princess esb  the og love theme it has a timeless quality that captures the love in the face of adversity vibe the two share through the movie asokha leaves clone wars  punctuating the excellent season 5 finale this track opens with one of my favorite mixes of the force theme before drifting into its own melody highlighting asokhas sadness and conflict at leaving the order main title various  gets me hype every time you know what this is not a specific version the imperial march esb  people somehow forget its completely absent from the original thats how ubiquitous this has become sabine suite rebels  there arent official soundtracks for seasons 34 as far as i can see but this is an alltimer used the youtube version perfectly capture the disgraced warrior vibe of the episode trials of the darksaber  the asteroid field esb  my favorite action piece in the series enhances the drama of heading into an area that probably should end our heroes the rise of skywalker the rise of skywalker  if this is indeed the last major theme of john williams what an awesome note to end it on one of two themes that i think could perfectly encapsulate the whole series this one feels like it could have existed in any decade of movie scores reys theme tfa  the beating heart of all three sequel soundtracks the use of the celeste instrument gives it a mix of williams star wars and williams harry potter duel of the fates tpm  they held nothing back for this energetic piece covering the duel at the end of the movie quoted frequently in unrelated situations throughout the prequel era because this piece was too dope not to princess leias theme anh  the true masterpiece of the original soundtrack even more than the main theme i dare any new composer to beat it across the stars attack of the clones  the only episode ii song on this list but its a gem could easily capture the sense of the whole series yodas theme esb  somehow hits me in the feels pretty much no matter what context in which it is played captures the wonder i hope future kids feel when exposed to this series what do you think like the list what are some omissions you would have put on it,0,9836,1703,0,0.107,0.74,0.153,0.9984

1518,Leia is one of the strongest people in canon and I love her,32,ivfqnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/ivfqnh/leia_is_one_of_the_strongest_people_in_canon_and/,2,1600495703.0,"Leia was born under pretty messed up circumstances. Her father Anakin chocked her mother Padme practically to death and sapped away her desire to live due to his horrifying crimes. She came into the care of Bail Organa, one of Padme's closest friends and allies. Padme herself persistently frustrated Palpatine's attempts to shake the Republic apart and inflict misery on the galaxy. Palpatine underestimated her completely. Inspired by her, Bail Organa and Mon Mothma together formed the Rebel Alliance to oppose Palpatine, and Leia herself joined when she became aware of the struggle and its importance. In a characteristic Sith hubris, Palpatine repeated his mistake again, underestimating Leia too. She was later reunited with her brother and they together managed to prevail over the Empire and Anakin was saved in the end. And this was after she watched her adoptive father get vaporized by the Empire, after she was tortured by her own father, after her father turned her lover into a wall decoration, and after she ended up as a slave of an ugly alien crime lord. She went through a lot already!

But Palpatine, being the demon he was, relied on some tricks he picked up from his old master Darth Plagueis to cheat death. He retreated into the shadows and began plotting his return... and the key piece of the demon's plan was to corrupt Ben Solo, Leia's son. Leia's father was a monster who murdered her mother, her son became a monster too, while her own brother, and her own husband too both abandoned her and left her all alone. She had to watch the second rise of the Empire as the New Republic sat around and did nothing, and eventually, she got demonized and dismissed as a warmonger and an extremist for taking a stand against it. And then when push came to shove and the Republic was destroyed, Leia and her Resistance became the last hope for the galaxy. Her own son killed his father, her husband, and her brother had to give his life to save her and the Resistance from him. And Rey, a young scavenger from Jakku remained the last Jedi...

And then Leia had to deal with the fact that not only her son was out there terrorizing the galaxy with endless legions of merciless hordes, but her pupil and the last hope of the Jedi was actually the granddaughter of Palpatine himself! The same undead demon who's been haunting the galaxy for decades now. The delicious irony here is that Leia succeeded where three generations of Jedi masters before her failed. And guess what, Palpatine underestimated her again, and he underestimated her pupil too! She brought her son back, she kept Rey on the right path, and her bold leadership eventually allowed the Resistance to prevail and bring an end up the Sith and their Empire for good...

To summarize... I adore Leia, I adore Padme, and I adore Rey. All I am missing now in my life is at least two seasons of an animated show depicting Leia training Rey. Leia being a Jedi Master was awesome and hearing Rey call her ""master"" in TROS was awesome too.

Then TPM came out, and everyone hated him, accusing him of “raping their childhood.”

AOTC comes out he gets more hate. Less in quantity, but hate nonetheless.

ROTS fizzed out some of it, but it didn’t compensate for the 6 years of nonstop complaints he received.

A decade later, he’s still not in good terms with a lot of the fanbase. Then Disney buys Star Wars, makes the ST, and now all of the sudden he’s a saint?!?

But, from what I can tell, the only reason many fans like him is only so they can use him as leverage to hate the ST.

They also use the example that George Lucas didn’t like the ST to hate on it, and that is perfectly valid. GL did not like the ST.

But the reason for that is because the ST was *made for fans!* So people say they dislike the ST because it dishonors the fanbase, and it does the exact opposite! It panders to them!

Now, I’m not saying if you disliked the ST you’re not a true fan (I disliked many parts of the ST), but it’s because of the fans hating the PT that got us the ST in the first place! (I’m not saying that the ST is bad either)

And now, and this is what is the most bewildering, they want George to come back?!? After they bullied him?!? They want George Lucas to leave his retirement and his children to satisfy the wants of a fanbase that bullied him?

They took the wrong conclusion regarding the force. They were emotionally suppressed through not being allowed to form attachments and they took children from their homes, indoctrinating them.

This was heightened by the Clone Wars TV show, where they basically abandon Ahsoka, among other things.

In Legends, when Luke makes a New Jedi Order, he makes a better order.

I’m curious if deconstruction of the Jedi order was how Lucas intended the Prequel Jedi to be interpreted, or if Lucas genuinely did think that this is how a wise group of monks would/should act.

I ask because it seems like Lucas has a couple morally questionable views, like not addressing the rights of sentient droids.

Furthermore, the use of the Clone army is slave labour. Do you think that was also intended?

Say it turns out she survived TLJ. Given that TROS had a theme of people from different origins coming together to oppose evil, you could do something really interesting with Phasma - give her a redemption arc, a way out, a story which allows her to transcend all that stuff that happened to her in the past. Her redemption would then culminate around the time of TROS, around the time I would put a hypothetical stormtrooper rebellion in the story, inspired by Finn, as Finn doesn't really have to be physically present to be a symbol.

I was a little surprised that some people thought this was out of character for Vader. In my opinion, it perfectly lines with what we know of our favorite Sith Lord and I'll explain why. Also I know I said I will upload my Ben Solo analysis soon but I'm splitting it into parts and I don't know yet when the first one will be released. Anyway, lets get started.

Firstly lets just say that Vader never destroyed the tomb. He was going to but he stopped himself after seeing a memory of Padme. Some might be annoyed at the fact that Vader would even do it in the first place. But remember, at this point in his life, Darth Vader views Anakin Skywalker and his life as a Jedi as completely separate from him . He wants to kill every last reminder of the man he once was and it doesn't surprise me that he would do something like this. Hell, not only did this guy betray his ""family"" and kill innocent children, but he force choked his wife This was on Mustafar and while yes he thought she betrayed him and was angry, he still did it nonetheless with that moment trying to signify that Anakin is long gone. Sure, he loves his wife and wants to save her, but it is clear from that response alone that his love for her is extremely possessive and not healthy. In the 2015 Darth Vader comic he remembers that moment, saying that Anakin Skywalker was dead and he ""killed"" him. So really, it doesn't surprise me that he would attempt to destroy Padme's tomb. If anything, it adds to the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.

HOWEVER, this is Darth Vader after ESB and his encounter with Luke. Him stopping himself from destroying the tomb shows that his conflict is growing stronger and Anakin Skywalker is slowly returning, despite not wanting to admit that. This conflict started because of Luke's existence. That moment wasn't a betrayal of Anakin. On the contrary, it is showing the beginning of the end of Darth Vader, and the return of Anakin Skywalker, the return of the Jedi, as well as showing just how important Luke is as he is the last reminder (besides Leia but he doesn't know about her being related to him yet) of Padme and a representation of a potential future with a loving family, and that is the only thing that can redeem his father. And that is why I think the moment in the comic doesn't betray the character of Anakin Skywalker.",StarWarsCantina,"no darth vaders character wasnt betrayed nor ruined dark heart of the sith spoilers do not read ahead i made a mistake vader was trying to open the tomb not destroy it im so sorry it wont happen again a preview of the latest darth vader dark heart of the sith comic came out a few days ago which involved darth vader destroying padmes tomb i was a little surprised that some people thought this was out of character for vader in my opinion it perfectly lines with what we know of our favorite sith lord and ill explain why also i know i said i will upload my ben solo analysis soon but im splitting it into parts and i dont know yet when the first one will be released anyway lets get started lets just say that vader never destroyed the tomb he was going to but he stopped himself after seeing a memory of padme some might be annoyed at the fact that vader would even do it in the first place but remember at this point in his life darth vader views anakin skywalker and his life as a jedi as completely separate from him  he wants to kill every last reminder of the man he once was and it doesnt surprise me that he would do something like this hell not only did this guy betray his family and kill innocent children but he force choked his wife this was on mustafar and while yes he thought she betrayed him and was angry he still did it nonetheless with that moment trying to signify that anakin is long gone sure he loves his wife and wants to save her but it is clear from that response alone that his love for her is extremely possessive and not healthy in the 2015 darth vader comic he remembers that moment saying that anakin skywalker was dead and he killed him so really it doesnt surprise me that he would attempt to destroy padmes tomb if anything it adds to the tragedy of anakin skywalkerdarth vader

(There are a lot of items that came up last night so this is gonna be a somewhat lengthy stream of thoughts from my viewing.)

Episode 9 was sort of an oddball movie for me because it felt weird trying to process all of the different parts of the film after seeing it whiz by like that in the theaters. That alongside the fandom on all sides being very angry and fighting left and right over it just made me felt sick trying to think right about the movie. I was torn over the parts that I liked/didn't like as much, over trying to find a stable stance on the movie and resisting to jump to one side of the fights over the movie being good or bad, and not wanting to feel terrible over liking certain items or getting overtly worked up about some stuff that felt off initially in my first viewing. This inevitably led me to stop my engagement with the fandom for a while so I could get away from the forum wars and keep my head fresh, and led me to disengage with Star Wars for a while just so I could take a break from it all and focus in on other hobbies or games.

Slowly after some time of clearing my mind on Star Wars, I started to get engaged in the franchise again. I got back in the groove of checking out a few classic and newer Star Wars games. I finished up the last season of The Clone Wars, and I've jumped back into checking out old clips of my favorite moments from the series. Still, I had not been able to get back into rewatching Episode 9 right away, partially due to still feeling off about the film, partially due to laziness, and partially due to getting busy trying to catch up on a lot of other movies and games I was behind on. But now, after getting some time to think out some parts of the film, and after feeling now was the right time to squeeze in a bit of Star Wars movie viewing while in quarantine, I went ahead and watched the final arc of The Rise of Skywalker, and it was the most fun I had with Star Wars in a long time.

Rewatching the whole experience, from the return to Exogol to the final return to Tatooine, I felt like a kid again. It gave the same chills and vibes when I rewatched Revenge of the Sith, Rogue One, and the first few sequel films many times before and in the days prior to Episode 9's theatrical release. The battle over Exogol was a thrilling visual experience with the grand battle between the Emperor's fleet and the largest resistance fleet of both fighters and ordinary people that we have seen with Star Wars on film. I felt chills again when I saw Lando lead all of the fighters out of the nebula with the Falcon. Palpatine felt menacing in about the same way he did for me when I saw him in Episode 3, and his battle with Kylo and Rey was pretty cool too (with the Force Drain technique reminscent of stuff you'd see in KOTOR [at least from what I've seen in many lore videos] and his final demise at the hands of his own Force Lightning [lol almost like he can't give up his signature move despite him frying his face with Windu on Coruscant]). And Ben Solo's final moments, with his gesturing just like Han and his last smile before becoming one with the Force, all felt great to watch again. The Resistance's celebration on Ajan Kloss was very beautiful and heartfelt to watch again; the musical score paired up with seeing Rey, Poe, and Finn reunite after the final battle really tugged at my heartstrings. And the finale on Tatooine with the return to the Lars Homestead and Rey and BB-8 staring off into the sunset were a nice final touch.

Overall, it was a fun, exciting, and beautiful experience getting back into rewatching Episode 9 again through the final arc. There are a few things that still felt a bit off. The Knights of Ren and the Sith Troopers could have had a bit more ""oomph"" in terms of battle scenes to show how menacing they could be (particularly the Sith Troopers considering how powerful they can be displayed within the new Battlefront 2). A few items could have used a bit more clarity, particularly how Palpatine planned to transfer himself into Rey by having him kill her for a ritual, and Finn's special secret he meant to tell Rey (After seeing a few videos and looking at the last scenes, I think he was alluding to being slightly Force-sensitive, especially when we see him worry about Rey after she collapses after defeating Palpatine, but it could have been reinforced more with a few examples of him using the Force to make it more apparent). And the concept of Rey as a ""Palpatine"" or ""Skywalker"" still feels slightly off when it rolls off the tongue, although I am still processing it and thinking more on it, and it doesn't bother me as much as it did before. And I do need to put aside some time for myself to sit down and rewatch the full movie again to engage in it again. But nonetheless, jumping back into The Rise of Skywalker's final arc was overall one of the most fun experiences I've had with Star Wars recently, and I'm looking forward to jumping back into this

It's kinda like a bookend to what Kylo said to Rey in TLJ. When Kylo said to Rey ""You are nothing"", that was related to the fact that Rey had no idea what her place is or if she has any place in the story. She was massively failed by her mentor and her legend, and she was lonely and she drifted towards someone she really believed in. And that this guy failed her too. That was where Rian wanted to put her. But when she rejected him and pulled the lightsaber, she made her choice - she is a Jedi! Then in TROS, she learns that the place that was meant for her is exact opposite of the one she chose for herself! Such a great twist for her, because the past two movies have both been about challenging the protagonist to see if they will remain true to themselves. She gets challenged to the core to keep her faith in herself and her friends. She is the last Jedi... but also the lost princess of the Sith! And with the help of Ben Solo and her inner strength, she prevails. When Palpatine screams at her ""You are nothing!"", this time, she has no doubts. She knows who she is and what she needs to do. Her journey is complete. And she bravely gives her life to save her friends and the galaxy from the demon that has haunted them all for decades now. It's so sweet and powerful.

I'll be honest, in TFA, I found Rey very irritating. TLJ really began warming me up to her. And the ending of TLJ was what set me up for TROS, because I really began feeling her! And then TROS finally sealed the deal and made me actually fall in love with her as a character. The ending of TROS was just so phenomenal. Rey... Skywalker. Talk about pay off for a random line in TFA I completely forgot about... the belonging Rey sought was not behind her, but ahead of her! I can honestly say now that Rey is my favorite character in Star Wars. If someone told me that I would feel that way back when TFA came out, I would think they are nuts...",StarWarsCantina,you are nothing a scavenger girl is no match for the power in me this line and moment always sounded so cool to me kinda like a bookend to what kylo said to rey in tlj when kylo said to rey you are nothing that was related to the fact that rey had no idea what her place is or if she has any place in the story she was massively failed by her mentor and her legend and she was lonely and she drifted towards someone she really believed in and that this guy failed her too that was where rian wanted to put her but when she rejected him and pulled the lightsaber she made her choice  she is a jedi then in tros she learns that the place that was meant for her is exact opposite of the one she chose for herself such a great twist for her because the past two movies have both been about challenging the protagonist to see if they will remain true to themselves she gets challenged to the core to keep her faith in herself and her friends she is the last jedi but also the lost princess of the sith and with the help of ben solo and her inner strength she prevails when palpatine screams at her you are nothing this time she has no doubts she knows who she is and what she needs to do her journey is complete and she bravely gives her life to save her friends and the galaxy from the demon that has haunted them all for decades now its so sweet and powerful be honest in tfa i found rey very irritating tlj really began warming me up to her and the ending of tlj was what set me up for tros because i really began feeling her and then tros finally sealed the deal and made me actually fall in love with her as a character the ending of tros was just so phenomenal rey skywalker talk about pay off for a random line in tfa i completely forgot about the belonging rey sought was not behind her but ahead of her i can honestly say now that rey is my favorite character in star wars if someone told me that i would feel that way back when tfa came out i would think they are nuts,0,2046,400,0,0.085,0.768,0.147,0.9865

I have heard that though back in 2017 everyone seemed to really hate the idea that Rey was a nobody (which i always kind of liked) that after getting to the very end of the saga, when given a choice between being a hero (skywalker/Kenobi) or a palpatine or a nobody it seems like more people today pick nobody as making the most sense. 

It makes me think how much nicer the ending would have been if JJ had not dicked around with this aspect of the movies so much. He is the one that created the mystery box of it to begin with, and now Ridley is saying she was told by him she was going to be a relation to Ben Kenobi. Then Rian Johnson changed that (IMO for the better) and made her a nobody. Then JJ changed it again for ep9 and Ridley again seems to be claiming she was told Palpatine, then possibly back to Kenobi, then this or that etc. Essentially that JJ all through development and filming of ep 9 seemed to not really be sure what he wanted. 

However, I honestly think that his fickle nature on this kind of ruined this aspect of the picture. IMO Johnson saved the day making her nobody. Partially because this fits really well with the character JJ created in ep7. We meet Rey and she is very much waiting, her life on hold trying to figure out how she fits into the universe. I think if they had left her a nobody it would have narratively fit better. They could still do palpatine if they wanted. Have him coming after Ben Solo to fill the role he wanted Rey for. (kill him take over as emperor etc) This not only fits better with what we had in ep 4-6 but could allow for all taht diad nonsense to be left out. Rey nobody then becomes the one person in the galaxy that can teach Ben about caring of other people and being cared for. Bringing him back from the edge. 

We can still have Ben finally in the end choose to give him life for Her. Nothing says we couldnt still have force healing in that you are giving your life force to someone else to heal them and ben in the end decides to save Rey by giving her enough of himself that she lives and he is unable to. But now think when we reach that final scene on Tattooine when Rey is asked for her name and says Skywalker, rather then saying no your a palpatine it becomes a signal that from ep 7-9 Rey has now found the place she wishes to move forward from in life. She is now choosing to stop being a nobody and become a skywalker and live according to those ideals of service and sacrifice. 

Just a thought.",StarWarsCantina,ending to the saga so i was thinking today i have heard that though back in 2017 everyone seemed to really hate the idea that rey was a nobody which i always kind of liked that after getting to the very end of the saga when given a choice between being a hero skywalkerkenobi or a palpatine or a nobody it seems like more people today pick nobody as making the most sense  makes me think how much nicer the ending would have been if jj had not dicked around with this aspect of the movies so much he is the one that created the mystery box of it to begin with and now ridley is saying she was told by him she was going to be a relation to ben kenobi then rian johnson changed that imo for the better and made her a nobody then jj changed it again for ep9 and ridley again seems to be claiming she was told palpatine then possibly back to kenobi then this or that etc essentially that jj all through development and filming of ep 9 seemed to not really be sure what he wanted  i honestly think that his fickle nature on this kind of ruined this aspect of the picture imo johnson saved the day making her nobody partially because this fits really well with the character jj created in ep7 we meet rey and she is very much waiting her life on hold trying to figure out how she fits into the universe i think if they had left her a nobody it would have narratively fit better they could still do palpatine if they wanted have him coming after ben solo to fill the role he wanted rey for kill him take over as emperor etc this not only fits better with what we had in ep 46 but could allow for all taht diad nonsense to be left out rey nobody then becomes the one person in the galaxy that can teach ben about caring of other people and being cared for bringing him back from the edge  can still have ben finally in the end choose to give him life for her nothing says we couldnt still have force healing in that you are giving your life force to someone else to heal them and ben in the end decides to save rey by giving her enough of himself that she lives and he is unable to but now think when we reach that final scene on tattooine when rey is asked for her name and says skywalker rather then saying no your a palpatine it becomes a signal that from ep 79 rey has now found the place she wishes to move forward from in life she is now choosing to stop being a nobody and become a skywalker and live according to those ideals of service and sacrifice  a thought,0,2524,491,0,0.03,0.865,0.105,0.9824

Ben Solo created the façade of “Kylo Ren” to hide his constant, internal struggle with who he was supposed to be – a Jedi Knight, strong in the light like his Uncle Luke OR a Darksider, embracing the dark like his grandfather Vader.

I like how in each film we get to see a different side of Ben:

TFA: Darkside Ben

TLJ: Conflicted Ben

TROS: Supreme Leader Ben

In TFA we’re introduced to the “mask” of Kylo Ren, which hides the face of Ben Solo as he massacres a village and rages within the halls of his Star Destroyer. This is the film where Ben Solo is trying his hardest to be a darksider as he performs many malicious deeds, with the killing of his father being the final straw that breaks the “mask” he’s been hiding behind.

In TLJ we literally see the mask smashed into pieces, after Snoke accurately analyzes Ben’s post-TFA situation – killing his father broke his spirit to the bone and he does have too much of his father’s heart in him. The mask remains off for the rest of the film since Ben is conflicted with who he is supposed to be. He is no longer blindly embracing the darkside like he did in TFA as he’s not able to pull the trigger on his mother and begins to have a relationship with the “enemy” Rey.

In TROS Ben has grown up and he’s made his choices, with the death of his father haunting him the most. He accepts what he is now – which is the Supreme Leader of a fascist regime – and there’s no going back, which is why he puts the mask back on. After his internal conflict in TLJ, he’s accepted his darkside fate, believing there is no turning back and he wants Rey to share the same path. Ben believes he was destined to be the next “Emperor” of the Galaxy until the “enemy” Rey shows him that even he, someone who’s done such horrible deeds, can still be loved. He didn’t think he was worth saving, but Rey thought he was, and this is why he turns back to the light.

Ben Solo is such a great character and every time that mask comes off, we see the conflict in his soul.

\-In TFA he’s being the person Snoke thinks he should be which is a darksider.

\-In TLJ he’s trying to carve his own path, since Snoke’s test of killing his father didn’t do what Snoke said it would: which was to make him more powerful in the darkside.

\-In TROS, due to his horrible choices, he accepts that maybe he is a darksider, but “Ben Solo” is still there, under the cracked mask.

The ST begins with Ben doing his best dark side impression and ends with Ben embracing his true path which is letting the light guide him and his actions.",StarWarsCantina,"the mask of kylo ren was merely a “shell” around ben solo and each film in the st actually gave us a different version of ben

1651,Info from the Disney/Star Wars marketing conference,0,irv4dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/irv4dj/info_from_the_disneystar_wars_marketing_conference/,7,1600017520.0,"Hi! I need to use this new account to keep my identity secret.

A few weeks ago I was able to go to a Disney marketing conference where they talked about their marketing plans for the next several months and the next year.

Its first part was all about their original productions, Pixar, Fox, and TV. Then they talked about the new Marvel series for Disney Plus, and finally, it was time for everything Star Wars.

**Live-action:** They didn't say anything about the new movies. But they were talking about their Disney Plus series.

They mostly talked about season two of **The Mandalorian,** which is coming in October. I still don't quite understand the story, but I guess the point is that in Season One, the remnants of the Empire revealed themselves, and in this one, they will be chased by the Republic. But they will still try to capture The Child. The Mandalorian will protect The Child and will try to find some Force Users that he hopes will help him. They said it was an opportunity to introduce some characters from the animated series, but they were not specific. The Mandalorian will also try to find its tribe that has reunited with other Mandalorians under the leadership of some female figure. Interestingly, they showed her without a helmet. She had ginger hair and jetpack.

They showed a short teaser of the new season. There were cute new shots of The Child, Moff with his black lightsaber, some Jawas, Mando riding a speeder bike, and even the classic AT-AT walker!

They also said that season three will be released next Fall. They didn't talk about the details, except that there will be a time jump between seasons two and three.

They also talked about the new show, which has no release date as of yet. It's a Cassian series, **a Rogue One spin-off.** They said it is not going to be one story, but more like an anthology that would show us Cassian at different stages of his life. In some episodes, we will see Diego Luna as Cassian. They didn't show any shots or clips, just a few concept arts. I don't remember all of them, but there was definitely an Imperial shuttle crashed in the middle of some town, a droid factory that produced droids that looked like K-2SO, Cassian and K2 with two female alien soldiers, and Cassian fighting with some bully with the crowd cheering in the background.

They said the future of Star Wars in the coming years is at Disney Plus and that live-action series are now their top priority.

Animated series: there will be two new animated series next year. Bad Batch in Spring and a **new series** in the Fall, which they didn't reveal any details about, just said that it is coming.

As for **Bad Batch**: again, it's supposed to be something of an anthology about post-war veteran clones. The Bad Batch group will want to be part of some larger community, but they won't be able to fit into society. They will work with pirates, smugglers, ex-separatists, and even Jedi. They will be mercenaries and bounty hunters. It has been said that the most moving thing will be that at some point they will have to stand up against their fellow clones. A graphic was shown of a split helmet, part of which was a classic stormtrooper and part was a clone helmet from EIII.

**Galaxy's Edge**: not too much info here. There will be new products and toys based on characters and other theme park elements. Some are supposed to be in stores already, and some will be released next year.

**The High Republic**: this is a publishing project that is supposed to bring more people to the world of Star Wars books and comics. Most of the information I've heard is already out on the internet.

They said the project will be phased, with a second phase coming next summer. The authors are to change over. So, for example, a guy who releases a novel now will write a comic in 2021. The plot is all about the Jedi trying to overcome the threat of Nihil Viking-like raiders and the Nameless creature, a puppet master who is somehow related to the ancient Sith or sth. The project will be widely advertised and other SW media will also refer to it. There will even be a wave of products and toys next year. They showed gold and black box with a female Jedi holding a green lightsaber as the key character.

In the end, they showed Star Wars 2021 key artwork. In the heart, there were Luke, Rey, and Anakin from the movies They were surrounded by characters from new projects. Ahsoka from The Clone Wars, The Child and The Mandalorian, Thrawn from Rebels, The Bad Batch team, and the group of Jedi from The High Republic series. Under the Star Wars logo, there was writing: 'The Galaxy Expands'.

I think that's it. I feel like I forgot something. If it comes to my mind, I will write about it. If you have any questions, you can ask me.

And unabashedly, some of those things are zany and kooky. But also playful and unassuming.

Sometimes I watch this movie and I imagine how people who don't like it see it and then I just become sad. And then I stop seeing it how they do and see it how I see it. And I'm reminded each time I see it how much I love the story and themes, the characters, their struggles and triumphs, the highs and the lows.

Like when I first saw it I was so in awe. And when Rose & Finn arrived at Canto Bight and the scenes played out I was enraptured by the whimsical atmosphere: the strange aliens, the wardrobes, the silly music, the architecture, the textures of the environment, all of it. Each time I watch it I feel as if I am a child watching my first Star Wars for the first time. And Rose's theme as it plays when the Fathiers crash onto the moonlit beach is *chef's kiss*

And one thing that stood out to me more than any other sequel film or any other scene in The Last Jedi itself was the lighting in Canto Bight. It seems so abstract and subtle and I don't know if this makes sense but it was unmistakably Star Wars lighting. I mean diegetically speaking i.e., the in-universe lighting. It's just different I'm not sure if I can articulate it. Like imagine stepping into a place where the light (natural or otherwise) is just slightly different enough but it has its own vibe about it. I think Canto Bight nailed that Star Wars-esque lighting perfectly and it really immersed me. I was just there with them looking for the codebreaker. The whole film is like that in regards to the diegetic light like on the Raddus or in the Falcon, but it really stands out to me in Canto Bight is all.

I dunno, y'all.

1675,The Sequels to the Sequels,5,iqva5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iqva5m/the_sequels_to_the_sequels/,7,1599874688.0,"So this is just a discussion of a hypothetical “sequels to the sequels.” So let’s say that you are approached by Lucasfilm/Disney about a project, be it books, games, a tv show, movies, or comics detailing a follow up to the events of the Sequel Trilogy. Only rules are it has to be after the events of the Rise of Skywalker. What do you make? I’ll give my idea as an example:

An animated miniseries, with a predetermined number of seasons, following two main storylines that eventually connect. The first is the political conclusion of the Resistance/First Order War. The Republic forces launch an expedition led by General Poe Dameron, along with General Finn and General Rose Tico, into the Unknown Region, to finally destroy the First Order and liberate the planets under their control. Along the way they meet the Chiss and other Unknown Region civilizations, and have to negotiate alliances or treaties with them for safe passage. 

The second plot line is Rey reforming the Jedi Order, while seeking out the truth behind Palpatine’s Sith cult with the help of Ben Solo’s force ghost. This leads her into the Unknown Regions where there are force sensitives who have been hiding there since the Empire. 

The two plot lines connect when Rey and her Jedi agree to help the Republic liberate a planet that is the capital of the First Order. At some point during the battle Finn displays his ability with the force, something hinted at throughout the series. The ultimate conclusion is that they destroy the remnants of the First Order military and the last of the Sith Cultists. The remnants surrender and Rae Sloan, de facto Supreme Leader since the death of Palpatine, dissolves the First Order in exchange for amnesty. There’s an epilogue explaining what happened to everyone, and the story finally concludes. 

Along the way subplots from the Sequels are wrapped up.

1681,What are your favourite moments from each part of the Star Wars universe?,11,iqsfn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iqsfn6/what_are_your_favourite_moments_from_each_part_of/,17,1599866191.0,"I'm interested in hearing what your favourite moments or scenes are from different parts of the Star Wars universe - prequels, originals, sequels, TCW, rebels, Resistance, Mandalorian, whatever games you may have played (sorry for not knowing the names of many), books, etc. I'll start out with mine

Originals - ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me"". So much emotional weight in this line and the buildup to it throughout the entire trilogy. It's only made deeper by the prequels/TCW and seeing Anakin

Prequels - Obi wan vs Anakin's duel. Again, a really emotional duel with great choreography. It was the emotional climax of the prequels and it definitely paid off.

Sequels - It was a tossup between Han redeeming Ben and ghost Yoda with Luke. Eventually I decided to go with the scene from 8 - Yoda and Luke are two of my favourite characters in the saga, and seeing master and apprentice reunited in such a way with such great dialogue was amazing. I may not be a fan of everything in the movie, but I still think it's the best scene of the sequels for me.

Clone Wars - This show has a lot of different stories so it's not really fair to try to chose one great moment, but I had to chose the order 66 scene between Rex and Ahsoka. Both of those are great characters who were born in this show and with order 66 already one of my favourite scene from the prequels, seeing its impact on two of my favourite characters was incredibly taxing emotionally.

Rebels - Maul and Obi-Wan's duel and Maul's ultimate demise. There's something tragic about a man who spends his entire life trying to get revenge on someone else, only to ultimately fail and die in his hands. They didn't overkill it with a long duel, it's the symbolism and dialogue that truly makes this scene special.

Mandalorian - This might be a spoiler for those who haven't watched the finale of season 1. >!The moment when Gideon cllimbs out of his TIE with the darksaber was shocking, thrilling, mindblowing and exactly what Mando needed. It's made me very, very excited for S2 and how they'll explore the recent history of the darksaber (and subsequently Mandalore) since we last saw it being handed to Bo-Katan in Rebels.!<

Edit: I completely forgot the spin-offs, Rogue One and Solo.  
Credit to u/bald_jim for reminding me about this and also for what I wrote here for Rogue One.

Rogue One: I love the Vader hallway scene, and it lets you relive the fear of Vader from the OT before you knew he was Luke's father.... but I'll go with the death of the rebels (or more specifically the main crew) on the beach. Chirrut and Baze's sacrifice was noble and heroic, K-2SO made me realise for the first time I could feel legitimate pain for a droid's sacrifice, Bodhi's final act soon to be followed by his demise and the way Jyn and Cassian sat together and died on the beach as the explosion spreads was beautiful.    
Solo - I loved this movie a lot more than most people seem to, but I can't pinpoint one exact moment. I'll probably chose one of the final scenes, where Han shoots Beckett before he finishes his sentence. It's a nice homage to him shooting first, and also shows how much of a true scoundrel he is.

Books - I'm definitely doing the books injustice by clubbing them together into one category, but I haven't read enough to be able to list multiple favourite moments. I'll go with the beginning of the Darth Bane novel (I know, it's now no longer canon) where he teaches Zannah his own chilling philosophy that is by extension going to become the philosophy of the Sith for centuries to come.

1691,"Calling what Lucasfilm did with the sequels ""no plan"" is kinda wrong...",18,iqggt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iqggt9/calling_what_lucasfilm_did_with_the_sequels_no/,40,1599814745.0,"They had a plan, **a plan of deliberate ambiguity**. They weren't simply ad-libbing the movies and canon with no idea of what they were doing, they had a very good, logical reason for what they were doing. There was only ""no plan"" in the sense that nobody sat down before TFA and detailed every single little plot point, development, and character arc, and this is because this couldn't be done at all, as I will explain...

This is best reflected in the Aftermath trilogy of novels, which started coming out just before TFA and concluded months before Trevorrow left, JJ came back, and TLJ released. The conclusion, Empire's End, even contains the basic premise of TROS spelled out almost verbatim by one of Palpatine's Sith loyalists and advisors. This was BEFORE Trevorrow left, at the time when they all were still trying to write a script where Palpatine never comes back and Kylo is the main monster. If that materialized, then it would have been trivial to reinterpret canon in such a manner that the loyalist in question is just a lunatic who had no idea what he was talking about. As it turns out, since even before TFA, Lucasfilm was developing canon in a direction where Palpatine could easily return and it would fit like a glove, because the glove was flexible! As it turns out, Palpatine foresaw that the Empire could collapse and he spent years secretly exploring the Unknown Regions with probes and scouts, afterwards covertly shipping resources and infrastructure into the shadows in preparation for his ultimate plan - if he is ever killed, the Empire must be destroyed, because it doesn't deserve to exist on the account of failing to protect him, and a new Empire must rise instead. Now, you could interpret this in three different ways - a) Palpatine was just petty and the First Order is his final fuck you to the galaxy, b) Palpatine planned to resurrect himself along with his Empire, and c) Palpatine was actually serving some higher power. That c) interpretation, it would have been used if Snoke became the ultimate main bad guy in the sequels. The a) interpretation would have been used if Kylo was the monster in Episode IX. And they are now using b) interpretation because Palpatine came back in Episode IX. That is the product of Lucasfilm's **deliberate ambiguity**. It works exactly because Lucasfilm knew what they were doing!

Consider also this - the main person tasked with implementing the Contingency was a man called Gallius Rax, one of Palpatine's few true friends and allies. He was an orphan from guess what planet? Jakku! And the pinnacle of the Contingency involved gathering the combined strength of the Empire and the New Republic above Jakku and destroying them all, allowing Palpatine's loyalists to retreat into the Unknown Regions and resurrect the Empire afterwards. However, Rax died before the plan could be fulfilled, the New Republic won at Jakku, but the loyalists were still able to retreat in the Unknown Regions. The Republic celebrated the seeming victory and the end of the war, while Jakku became a graveyard of the Empire. And a few decades later, the lost princess of the Empire would be rummaging through the ruins of her grandfather's Empire and living in one of his destroyed war machines. Ungodly convenient, wouldn't you say?

But it isn't. It's a consequence of **deliberate ambiguity** in TFA and background canon. Why did Lucasfilm chose to make it like this? Well, the reason is obvious - the three director approach demanded it, because if you already have three directors, you want them to have as much freedom as possible, while also making sure canon doesn't become too much contradictory as a result of what happens in the movies. Hence you get Lucasfilm's guidance of canon development towards deliberate ambiguity, or the flexible glove, to use the analogy again. The conclusion in Episode IX, whatever it was, would signal the end of ambiguity and subsequent canon material would retcon away and smooth over any small inconsistencies.

A good plan, to be frank. And it would have worked flawlessly if Carrie didn't die and if later Lucasfilm and Trevorrow didn't fail to reach a compromise and produce a decent script...",StarWarsCantina,calling what lucasfilm did with the sequels no plan is kinda wrong they had a plan a plan of deliberate ambiguity they werent simply adlibbing the movies and canon with no idea of what they were doing they had a very good logical reason for what they were doing there was only no plan in the sense that nobody sat down before tfa and detailed every single little plot point development and character arc and this is because this couldnt be done at all as i will explain is best reflected in the aftermath trilogy of novels which started coming out just before tfa and concluded months before trevorrow left jj came back and tlj released the conclusion empires end even contains the basic premise of tros spelled out almost verbatim by one of palpatines sith loyalists and advisors this was before trevorrow left at the time when they all were still trying to write a script where palpatine never comes back and kylo is the main monster if that materialized then it would have been trivial to reinterpret canon in such a manner that the loyalist in question is just a lunatic who had no idea what he was talking about as it turns out since even before tfa lucasfilm was developing canon in a direction where palpatine could easily return and it would fit like a glove because the glove was flexible as it turns out palpatine foresaw that the empire could collapse and he spent years secretly exploring the unknown regions with probes and scouts afterwards covertly shipping resources and infrastructure into the shadows in preparation for his ultimate plan  if he is ever killed the empire must be destroyed because it doesnt deserve to exist on the account of failing to protect him and a new empire must rise instead now you could interpret this in three different ways  a palpatine was just petty and the first order is his final fuck you to the galaxy b palpatine planned to resurrect himself along with his empire and c palpatine was actually serving some higher power that c interpretation it would have been used if snoke became the ultimate main bad guy in the sequels the a interpretation would have been used if kylo was the monster in episode ix and they are now using b interpretation because palpatine came back in episode ix that is the product of lucasfilms deliberate ambiguity it works exactly because lucasfilm knew what they were doing also this  the main person tasked with implementing the contingency was a man called gallius rax one of palpatines few true friends and allies he was an orphan from guess what planet jakku and the pinnacle of the contingency involved gathering the combined strength of the empire and the new republic above jakku and destroying them all allowing palpatines loyalists to retreat into the unknown regions and resurrect the empire afterwards however rax died before the plan could be fulfilled the new republic won at jakku but the loyalists were still able to retreat in the unknown regions the republic celebrated the seeming victory and the end of the war while jakku became a graveyard of the empire and a few decades later the lost princess of the empire would be rummaging through the ruins of her grandfathers empire and living in one of his destroyed war machines ungodly convenient wouldnt you say it isnt its a consequence of deliberate ambiguity in tfa and background canon why did lucasfilm chose to make it like this well the reason is obvious  the three director approach demanded it because if you already have three directors you want them to have as much freedom as possible while also making sure canon doesnt become too much contradictory as a result of what happens in the movies hence you get lucasfilms guidance of canon development towards deliberate ambiguity or the flexible glove to use the analogy again the conclusion in episode ix whatever it was would signal the end of ambiguity and subsequent canon material would retcon away and smooth over any small inconsistencies good plan to be frank and it would have worked flawlessly if carrie didnt die and if later lucasfilm and trevorrow didnt fail to reach a compromise and produce a decent script,0,4274,724,0,0.077,0.826,0.097,0.9314

Jaro Kan’s father had worked in the archives of the Jedi temple before the days of the Empire. During his time there he came across a series of incomplete prophecies. Prophecies that had been handed down from one  generation to the next, but had never been fulfilled or looked into further. Jaro’s father would recite these to him as he would fall asleep at night. Tales of a dragon tamer who lived in the sand, or tales of two force-sensitive individuals mysteriously connected through space and  time. As he listened he found himself wondering why these no one had looked into these further. Could it have been possible that the prophecies themselves actually had been fulfilled, yet somehow no one knew about them? If the prophecies were true, it would change the course of the of a great many things in the galaxy.   
Years after the empire overtook the Jedi Order and the Republic, Jaro found himself hiding on the planet Batuu. Anyone known to have an association with the Jedi, even to those who were merely archive workers, were often taken in for intense questioning from the Empire, never to be heard from again. Jaro’s parents were unfortunately apart of these roundups.  To this day he still never quite knew if his parents were dead or alive.  He preferred to think the latter of those options, in hopes that they were not suffering at the hands of the empire.

jaro kan’s father had worked in the archives of the jedi temple before the days of the empire during his time there he came across a series of incomplete prophecies prophecies that had been handed down from one  generation to the next but had never been fulfilled or looked into further jaro’s father would recite these to him as he would fall asleep at night tales of a dragon tamer who lived in the sand or tales of two forcesensitive individuals mysteriously connected through space and  time as he listened he found himself wondering why these no one had looked into these further could it have been possible that the prophecies themselves actually had been fulfilled yet somehow no one knew about them if the prophecies were true it would change the course of the of a great many things in the galaxy   
years after the empire overtook the jedi order and the republic jaro found himself hiding on the planet batuu anyone known to have an association with the jedi even to those who were merely archive workers were often taken in for intense questioning from the empire never to be heard from again jaro’s parents were unfortunately apart of these roundups  to this day he still never quite knew if his parents were dead or alive  he preferred to think the latter of those options in hopes that they were not suffering at the hands of the empire

Not only am I trying to tell a new kind of Fan Story, but I'm trying to tell a new kind of Star Wars. Here's the summary:

*Padawan Calia Rayyah had spent virtually her entire life living high up in the Jedi Temple on the Republic's capital Coruscant. She had dreamed of being a Consular, negotiating peace and bringing the disparate beings of the galaxy together, and with the Clone Wars raging she imagined her talents would be needed more than ever.*

*Jedi Knight Richar Arten, has dedicated his life to the underlevels, to trying to make life better for the countless beings who struggled to survive against the crime, drugs and poverty which existed everywhere far below the notice of the Jedi and Republic.*

*Assigned as Arten's Padawan, Calia finds her world completely shattered as she is asked to spy on her new Master who the council believes may be in danger of falling to the Dark Side. Meanwhile, military-grade Republic weapons begin to find their way down to the underlevels, threatening to escalate the pain and violence to new levels. Master and Padawan will have to learn from each other if they have any hope of overcoming this new threat, and maybe make life just a little better below the temple.*

It's entirely original characters, minus a small cameo from a very minor character in the opening. I've always felt frustrated that most expanded universe stuff seems to focus on a relatively small cast of characters, either the characters from the films or those directly connected to them. 

I'm also just hoping to tell a smaller story. The films always focus on this huge Galactic scale where the fate of the entire Galaxy hangs in the balance, which is cool, and epic. However, I always wanted to see a story about the *little people*.  Expect twists and turns, but nothing world changing.

So here's a a vaugely film-noir, coming of age story, dealing with the material imbalances of the Republic, and  hypocrisy of the Jedi Order.

It's still a work in progress, but there's a fair number of chapters available for you to sink your teeth into, and there will hopefully new updates weekly, and if I can keep my momentum up this has the potential to become a a full-length trilogy. I'm more than welcome to any feedback or criticism, and would appreciate you taking the time to give my work a look.

A lot of people are skeptical of bringing Boba Fett back, along with adding Ahsoka to the show. Here’s my reason for believing these are not only possible, but smart decisions: 

1. Look at Dave Filoni’s story telling so far. From Clone Wars to Rebels, these are two shows that cover different time periods but have similar characters that exist in both. Having characters from Rebels carry over to The Mandalorian is pretty believable at this point. He also does it well, so I’m not worried. Not to mention that, but it seems as though he’s trying to tell a multi-generational story. I wouldn’t be surprised if this show connected with the eventual Rebels sequel (based on how Rebels ended and the time period this exists within). 

2. The previously announced then canceled Boba Fett movie is the “writing on the wall” that he’ll show up in this. The fact that they previously had plans to create a Boba Fett movie, but then changed their mind, means that they most likely decided it was better to include him in this show rather than give him his own property entirely. Fans have been wanting to see Boba Fett back in the films/shows for a looooooong time. It only makes sense that they’d try to include him here. Filloni also has been weaving in legends stories (ie Thrawn and Bane) for a while now. It only makes sense that he’d try and include the Legends stories of Boba Fett post ROTJ into the new canon as well.",StarWarsCantina,"why i think these two characters will show up in the mandalorian potential spoilers for season 2 although none of this has actually been confirmed

1741,What killed Vader/Anakin,15,iox0hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iox0hj/what_killed_vaderanakin/,18,1599612053.0,"I am posting here to see what others say about it after a comment of mine on the main sub last night got 800 upvotes and I realized not many thought of this.  


So in return of the Jedi, we see Vader get weak and die after throwing the Emperor down and being electrocuted. Growing up, I've always thought that Vader died because the electricity shut his machine down, causing him to die. However, over the last few years I have thought about this in a whole new way.  


In the 2017 Vader comics, we see the Emperor use lightning on Vader, and he seemed to shake it off. In a different comic (cant remember which one, maybe the first Vader run?), we see his suit get deactivated for a period of time, and he still managed to survive. And then Rebels season 2 we is severely injured at the end. What if the suit is not the thing keeping him alive, but rather the pain from the suit and his injuries.  


What if he died because he turned to the light side. Think about it. The dark side uses pain and suffering to get more powerful. He lost 4 limbs and was set on fire. No normal person could survive that, much like Maul being cut in half, or Darth Sion for Legends fans. But they could through the dark side. Maybe, him turning to the light meant that he could no longer use the pain of his suit and his injuries to sustain himself and keep living. Once he turned he had to let go, causing everything to catch up to him and kill him in the process.  
To me, Vader/Anakin did not die because of the lightning, but rather by turning the light and no longer being fueled by the pain he was constantly in.

In TROS Sidious tells Rey that he is all the Sith, and that he wants her to strike him down so that his essence will pass into her and she will be the new Empress. Further, he says that Luke Skywalker's father was there to save him, implying that by blocking Luke's attempt to strike down the Emperor, Vader effectively stopped Sidious from transferring the essence of all the Sith into Luke, which would have led to his turn to the dark side. 

My theory: after being thrown down the shaft by Vader, the essence of all the Sith transferred from Sidious to Anakin. Since Anakin didn't strike down Sidious out of hatred and did it out of love for his son, he was not consumed by the dark side spirits and they eventually transferred to Palpatine's clone on Exegol after killing Anakin. When Rey kills Palpatine on Exegol, I think the spirits of the Sith transferred from Sidious to her. But since she killed Sidious to save her friends, and not out of hatred, she was not consumed by the dark side and instead died, effectively ending the Sith. Then Ben sacrificed himself to revive her.

This theory is compatible with another pet theory of mine that if Mace Windu had succeeded in killing Sidious in ROTS, the Sith spirits would have transferred to him, and he would fall to the dark side and declare himself emperor (under the initial guise of ensuring a peaceful transition to power). This makes Anakin's actions in both the ROTS and ROTJ important in fulfilling the prophecy. He ensured that neither Mace nor Luke would fall to the dark side in the attempt to destroy the Sith, but fell short because he bought Sidious enough time to set up a contingency plan on Exegol, requiring Rey and Ben to make right.

while i got into star wars quite recently, those movies turned out to be my “emotional support” stories in this year. each and every of them have their flaws, but they are all larger than sum of their parts, and i found both hope and inspiration, while i expected nothing more than space entertainment.

in this post i want to focus on female characters - don’t @ me on agendas, etc. - i learned so much from characters of Luke, Anakin, Kenobi, Ben Solo, Finn, Poe, and others, but i simply resonated more with Leia, Rey, Padme, Jyn, Hera, Sabine, Ahsoka, Rose… there were so many moments where i would feel powerless and hopeless, and actually thinking how this fictional characters defied the odds and remained headstrong in disastrous situations, and them being so relatable, would inspire more optimistic outlook and confidence in me.

Like, hey, Leia watched her planet being blown up, she took her adoptive father’s place in the Rebellion, she led others and stood her ground until the very end despite all the tragedies and difficulties she faced.

Rey grew up abandoned, scavenging for life, but she was strong, independent, willing to fight for herself and for what she believed in, and to face her worst fears, no matter how hard it was.

Padme was a fierce leader since she was 14. She was compassionate, loyal, always fighting for what she deemed right.

Jyn lost everything as a little girl, including hope, and not only regained it, but inspired a new spark in others.

Hera is so determined, brave and resourceful, a great pilot and a leader, but also such a warm and understanding person.

Sabine starts out as a spunky teenager, but grows into mature, assertive and open-minded young woman (also, she is an artist, like i am, so bonus points).

Ahsoka grows over disillusionment with the Jedi Order, and tragedy of Order 66, and keeps all the most noble traits of Jedi becoming a wise and insightful not-a-jedi master.

Rose is courageous, strong-willed and empathetic, besides being a talented mechanic - willing to do what has to be done, whether some like it or not.

Oh, and selfless, nurturing, hardworking Shmi…

I could count more of them, but i will leave it at that for this occasion. as i said, mentioned characters and their stories just resonate more with me in some difficult moments; yes, i am a woman, and yes, actually seeing strong woman characters handling challenging situations and not just being damsels in distress is very inspiring and empowering when you have to be your own hero, even if they are just fictional characters from a galaxy far, far away. i know so many real-life everyday heroines, but a dash of storytelling magic sometimes gives you another push to overcome obstacles, and fictional characters can function as a catalysts of sort.

today i experienced threats and harassment from a drunken neighbour, who insulted me and my mother and told me he’d kill me, after i refused to talk to him and firmly asked him to get off our window (we live in a ground-level apartment, and he was lurking in and calling us out). i never even spoke to him before, and he is only an occasional tenant in his grandmother’s flat. this is the first time i have faced that kind of aggression, and i was sooo angry, and frightened. i didn’t know what to. and in a split second, thought, what would leia, or rey, or padme, or ahsoka do? would they back off? no, they’d stood their ground and confront a damn bully!

i confronted him, called him out on his insults, harassments, all the troubles and drunken late-night outbursts him and his girlfriend disturb everyone in the building on regular basis. i repeatedly and firmly asked (khm, yelled, khm) to leave us alone or i will call the police, and when i did call them, he disappeared. big brave drunken bully with a police record.

police couldn’t do much, but i stood up today. i fought back. and that is something. and i will continue to fight whenever and wherever needed. and you know, being a 117 pound young woman, when confronted with a guy significantly larger than me, i kind of easier relate to leia or rey in similar situation, than luke or anakin.

so, if you read this far, thanks for reading my rant - i just really wanted to show how sometimes hope, strength and inspiration can be found in unusual places/characters, in most unusual circumstances, and i am grateful for those characters to be with me.",StarWarsCantina,how leia rey padme ahsoka and other women of sw inspire me in challenging situations  50 venting 50 appreciation post so this probably wont be a regular appreciation post but it’s been a rough day and i have a need to let it out and sometimes bunch of strangers who share your love for some movies are the best listeners i got into star wars quite recently those movies turned out to be my “emotional support” stories in this year each and every of them have their flaws but they are all larger than sum of their parts and i found both hope and inspiration while i expected nothing more than space entertainment this post i want to focus on female characters  don’t  me on agendas etc  i learned so much from characters of luke anakin kenobi ben solo finn poe and others but i simply resonated more with leia rey padme jyn hera sabine ahsoka rose… there were so many moments where i would feel powerless and hopeless and actually thinking how this fictional characters defied the odds and remained headstrong in disastrous situations and them being so relatable would inspire more optimistic outlook and confidence in me hey leia watched her planet being blown up she took her adoptive father’s place in the rebellion she led others and stood her ground until the very end despite all the tragedies and difficulties she faced grew up abandoned scavenging for life but she was strong independent willing to fight for herself and for what she believed in and to face her worst fears no matter how hard it was was a fierce leader since she was 14 she was compassionate loyal always fighting for what she deemed right lost everything as a little girl including hope and not only regained it but inspired a new spark in others is so determined brave and resourceful a great pilot and a leader but also such a warm and understanding person starts out as a spunky teenager but grows into mature assertive and openminded young woman also she is an artist like i am so bonus points grows over disillusionment with the jedi order and tragedy of order 66 and keeps all the most noble traits of jedi becoming a wise and insightful notajedi master is courageous strongwilled and empathetic besides being a talented mechanic  willing to do what has to be done whether some like it or not and selfless nurturing hardworking shmi… could count more of them but i will leave it at that for this occasion as i said mentioned characters and their stories just resonate more with me in some difficult moments yes i am a woman and yes actually seeing strong woman characters handling challenging situations and not just being damsels in distress is very inspiring and empowering when you have to be your own hero even if they are just fictional characters from a galaxy far far away i know so many reallife everyday heroines but a dash of storytelling magic sometimes gives you another push to overcome obstacles and fictional characters can function as a catalysts of sort i experienced threats and harassment from a drunken neighbour who insulted me and my mother and told me he’d kill me after i refused to talk to him and firmly asked him to get off our window we live in a groundlevel apartment and he was lurking in and calling us out i never even spoke to him before and he is only an occasional tenant in his grandmother’s flat this is the first time i have faced that kind of aggression and i was sooo angry and frightened i didn’t know what to and in a split second thought what would leia or rey or padme or ahsoka do would they back off no they’d stood their ground and confront a damn bully confronted him called him out on his insults harassments all the troubles and drunken latenight outbursts him and his girlfriend disturb everyone in the building on regular basis i repeatedly and firmly asked khm yelled khm to leave us alone or i will call the police and when i did call them he disappeared big brave drunken bully with a police record couldn’t do much but i stood up today i fought back and that is something and i will continue to fight whenever and wherever needed and you know being a 117 pound young woman when confronted with a guy significantly larger than me i kind of easier relate to leia or rey in similar situation than luke or anakin if you read this far thanks for reading my rant  i just really wanted to show how sometimes hope strength and inspiration can be found in unusual placescharacters in most unusual circumstances and i am grateful for those characters to be with me,0,4735,832,0,0.156,0.656,0.188,0.9901

I’ve been in this fight since I was 4 years old, yes I’m one upping Mr. Cassian Andor 😂 

I went to see Episode II in theaters in May 2002, the first Star Wars movie I ever saw in theaters, I was 4. It would be an understatement to say the film made an impression on me, I remember the experience so vividly!

The roar of the crowd for the “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...” and Star Wars flying across the screen with the title crawl which I had difficulty reading completely and skipped words lol, 

the tilt of the camera up after the crawl,
I saw the original Star Wars trilogy and Episode I, to remember how it tilted down to the stars,
so this felt new and I remember that, such a small detail and memory lol also shows how much I already rewatched the movies

John Williams delivered such an amazing musical score, Across the Stars, and the whole movie soundtrack is sooo good and it’s own thing entirely. I honestly think it is the reason I remember seeing this movie so well, the music.

Seeing the Jedi in their heyday, the movie is set with a mystery plot, the clones! Jango and Boba! The Jedi battling in an arena, words can’t describe the love I have for the movie and how it hit me, as a fan from an early age, this movie delivered everything I was a fan of, also Tatooine, the Lars homestead??? And finally the love story of Anakin and Padmé, how someone fell in love with the future Darth Vader, how someone so good turn to Darth Vader?? 

As I get older and rewatch it, the nostalgia is real, and am more grateful for the prequels. I never understood the hate so many people had for the prequels and Episode II alone.

I know the dialogue in AotC is ridiculed terribly, but I love it. It has Shakespearean vibe to it, or in this romantic period of the Jedi and Republic, so it makes sense the dialogue being this way and changing over time to the originals, it makes sense!

Also, Padmé said I love the water, it’s as arbitrary as Anakin saying he doesn’t like sand, in my opinion 😂",StarWarsCantina,"i ❤️ attack of the clones i love star wars episode ii attack of the clones this is a positive subreddit so i’m interested to see possibly other fans who love episode ii too been in this fight since i was 4 years old yes i’m one upping mr cassian andor 😂  went to see episode ii in theaters in may 2002 the first star wars movie i ever saw in theaters i was 4 it would be an understatement to say the film made an impression on me i remember the experience so vividly roar of the crowd for the “a long time ago in a galaxy far far away” and star wars flying across the screen with the title crawl which i had difficulty reading completely and skipped words lol  tilt of the camera up after the crawl

Poverty is common, vicious creatures are everywhere, terrorism is a daily occurrence, and the planet you live on could be blown up at any moment.

But you know what? As cool and kickass as all the war and battle stuff is, I want to see more slice of life content in the universe too. It’s always kind of cool when you see characters doing normal things in the universe. Like in Solo, when you see everyone enjoying a party on Dryden Vos’s yacht. In TROS, where there’s a festival with kites and sweets. And hell, Canto Bight, which has horse racing and slot machines. It’s always so surreal when you see that this world does have other things to do in it than suffer, rebel against the bad guys or be a bad guy yourself.

I would therefore love to see a Star Wars series or short film with little to no war elements. It sounds strange, but wouldn’t it be cool to have some content on a planet that the Empire/First Order never found? I want to see more happy times! Do these characters have birthdays? Do they have grand balls or costume parties? Do they ever go to the beach and goof off? Are there theme parks? Do they have Halloween? What do they watch on TV? Is there a galaxy-wide music chart? Where do characters shop for goods? What storybooks or fairy tales exist? I know we’ve seen bits of this stuff before (parties, celebrations and such) but I just think it would be wholesome to watch something in the Star Wars world that isn’t interrupted by stormtroopers breaking in and killing everyone.

Think about it! Rey is still untrained and Luke has become one with the Force. That leaves Leia as the sole remaining heir to the Jedi legacy.

I was kinda bummed out that we never really got to see Luke train Rey or the next generation of Jedi, but having Leia do it instead was a pretty awesome twist that I really love!

I first discovered Star Wars as a little kid back in 2007 when I went to the house of an old family friend and their kid was playing this cool shooting game with robots and people in white armour. He then showed me Revenge of the Sith on DVD. From there I played LEGO Star Wars  and watched all the movies. But I was never a big fan of the series. Until 2015 when The Force Awakens came out. I had somehow not heard about it until about a month before it came out. It was the first Star Wars movie I saw in theatres along with my father. I fell in love with all the characters and story and couldn’t wait to see more. When I saw The Last Jedi I was a little mixed on it but after seeing it a second time I saw the great story beats and characterisation in it. It was the same for The Rise of Skywalker.

I really connect with Rey’s Journey. Her desire to be important in the universe and find a family are beautiful to me and I was rooting for her in all three movies. Finns arc about letting go of his fear was very relatable to me regardless of how John felt about Finns writing. Poe Dameron is my Han Solo, loved seeing him learn to be a real leader. I enjoyed the Hammy performance of Hux and the legitimate intimidation of Pryde. Snoke was a cool red herring like Dooku before him and I loved the Palpatine reveal. It felt like a much more fitting end for him to me.

Ben Solo however is my favourite Star Wars Character. Period. For one simple reason. I’ve been where he is. During my edgy teens back in 2014-2018 I was involved in the anti sjw, alt right side of the internet and was taught too ignore sexual harassment, mock people different to me and to think that there was nothing wrong with how the world is while also being convinced the SJW where about to destroy my freedoms. I will forever be ashamed of who I was back then. So when I saw Kylo Ren. A similarly conflicted and corporated person be treated as a human being, capable of change and struggling to decide between power and love was extremely powerful to me. 

On top of just enjoying the movies they inspired me to pursue my passion for films and enter film school which has made my life so much better. These movies are my Trilogy and I will always hold them dearly.

So it is a little depressing to see them get so much hate. I understand why people don’t like them. But I always feel like there must be something wrong with me. Everyone else says they are terrible and they are probably smarter then me so what’s wrong with me.

I’m sorry for rambling so long.

What things would you like to explore, change, address, or examine?

To be honest, I would be really keen on going into the future, and I would like to toy around with the space fantasy core of Star Wars. I would want to go deep into exploring the nature of the Force, but I would also like to make the Jedi more like knights. I would drop the whole centralized religious cult business, and I would also definitively alter canon so that almost everyone can use the Force. My explanation would be that when balance was definitively restored with the final destruction of the Sith, the ensuing centuries of peace allowed the light to become dominant, so much so that ever larger groups of people felt the gifts of the Force. The new, pluralistic Jedi Knights would congregate around multitudes of temples which would be all across the stars. Certain places like Ahch-To or Ajan Kloss would be sacred places (I strongly suspect that Rey will establish her first temple on Ajan Kloss, because that's where she was trained and she was strongly attached to Leia), but there would be no single temple and no single council dictating everything. They wouldn't hoard knowledge of the Force, but share it freely among each other and with the peoples of the galaxy. As for the enemies... I have a couple of ideas, but the only thing that's a no-go is folks like Palpatine and Bane's line of Sith Lords. You'll never out-Hitler the space Hitler so we shouldn't try at all. If the Sith have any presence in the story, they will only be nuisances, and they will be mavericks completely disinterested in traditional Sith pursuits. Balance in the Force, whatever that is exactly, it not disrupted by the mere existence of dark siders. Nightsisters for example do not do anything to it. It seems that in order to throw the Force out of balance, the dark siders have to actively want to conquer the galaxy.

I remember the day I found out Disney was buying Lucasfilm. I was surprised, but I didn’t think much of it. Then I heard the rumors of a new Star Wars movie, then a trilogy, then the glorious day of confirmation from Lucasfilm and Disney that they *were working on a new trilogy*.

I screamed and did a happy dance for like 5 minutes. 

Then I remember the picture of the cast at their first table read. God, the possibilities, the potential, the excitement, the trailer during Super Bowl. It was all so amazing. 

Then TFA came out and I loved it. I saw it multiple times. And I was so filled with hope. Then TLJ came out, I loved that one too. I assumed everyone else felt either the same or neutral. 

Then came the shit show. The harassment of Kelly, the bullying of Daisey, the endless stream of arguments and hate from the “fans” claiming that Rian had “raped” their childhood. 

Then came Solo’s poor performance. The gleeful cackling from those same people that now wanted to see the franchise fail. The holds being put on other Star Wars projects while Disney regrouped. 

But I never lost hope! 

Nothing could stop me from feeling excited for TROS. I wanted it to prove to me and all the others how great it this story was. I wanted it to get the saga and the franchise back on track with everyone!

But I ended up feeling incredibly disappointed and letdown by the TROS. It had its great moments here and there but overall it was such bizarre, rushed film experience to me. It felt like 4 hour movie that had a bunch of key scenes cut out from it. 

Then came more hate, more backbiting, more petty drama between the cast and the fans. Even shows I enjoyed, like The Mandalorian, became cheap tools used to criticize the sequels. 

And now we/I wrap it all up with my favorite characters actor basically saying that he did not enjoy his experience in the saga, and likely putting to bed any hopes of seeing Finn in a stand-alone film. 

All in all, I feel so exhausted and drained from this. To go from where we were in 2014 to now is  kind of heartbreaking.

1851,"John's words were probably tough for a lot of us to hear, but it's important that we listen. [thread by a hardcore TLJ fan on a soapbox]",46,illr4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/illr4b/johns_words_were_probably_tough_for_a_lot_of_us/,50,1599131937.0,"To give some background on where I stand on this, I should point out that- one- I am a white, middle class American, and -two- I *love* TFA and TLJ. I think I can even say that TLJ is my single favorite film of all time (The other close contenders being Hot Fuzz, The Social Network, and Into the Spider-verse), and discussing it over the past few years has only cemented that. In fact, I give TLJ and Rian Johnson a great deal of credit for the passion I have for filmmaking, and TLJ played a huge role in my decision to go back to college to major in filmmaking last year. So, to say this film is important to me is an understatement. I could talk for hours and hours about the character arcs, symbolism, director's choices, thematic resonance, etc. I say all this to really emphasize how near and dear to my heart this film is, and to drive home how ~~overly~~ seriously I take discussing it. 

And while my tendency to defend and lavish praise on this movie has admittedly been a bit silly, and I can admit that I'm obsessive sometimes, I've never felt like there was any moral issue with rushing to its defense from people criticizing it. But that thought process was a bit shaken today, and for the first time, it felt like it came directly at odds with my desire to always empathize with and never invalidate the struggles that black people in the world are distraught over; specifically in this case, the pain that John felt over his experience with this franchise.

You can already probably see where the cognitive dissonance hit me here. How do I reconcile my bitterness about John's (needlessly?) harsh words about a movie and a director that are both so inspiring to me, with my desire to understand and acknowledge the very real pain he's feeling and has felt for years now?

The whole day, thoughts kept going through my head over ways to justify this- ""Surely he just misunderstood his own character's arc!"" ""Why is he seemingly throwing Rian under the bus when logistically not much of the creative choices he hates can be attributed solely to Rian?"" ""His pain is real, but his anger is just a bit misguided!"" And I'd see other people (including in this sub) commenting stuff like ""He's just a narcissist, he should be happy with what he got."" ""Other actors didn't complain as much as this guy.""

But this is where I realized that these questions just... didn't really matter right now, and that his opinions on a movie were the least important things in that GQ article. I was spending all of this time trying to validate something that I liked over considering what John -not Finn- had been through. Yes, TLJ is important to me and a lot of SW fans, but our desire to validate our opinions on it shouldn't come at the expense of learning from a fellow human being who is using his voice to shine a light on a vile systemic problem that runs very, *very* deep- not just in Hollywood, but throughout the world. 

So maybe the discussions about his takes on TLJ or the ST should wait, and we should instead focus on how we can learn from his words on things that are more important. We have our whole lives ahead of us to discuss our silly, delightful space movies. But the conversation that John is trying to spark is one that's much more important, and the fact that people are already focusing on his creative disagreements instead is a bit concerning to me.

Those of us who aren't POC should be instead looking at this and thinking about if/how we're contributing to the problem John described. And if we are contributing to the problem, then we should think about how we should change. 

For me personally, I'd like to be a filmmaker someday (if you didn't already infer that from me saying that I've been going to film school). Chances are I won't ever be a big name in the industry or anything, but I hope that I'm able to somehow use my talents someday in a way that uplift those less fortunate than I am and make them feel heard and valued, as they should be. I'm not really sure what that would look like for me just yet, but it's more important than arguing over John's words concerning a fictional character, don't you think?",StarWarsCantina,johns words were probably tough for a lot of us to hear but its important that we listen thread by a hardcore tlj fan on a soapbox to give some background on where i stand on this i should point out that one i am a white middle class american and two i love tfa and tlj i think i can even say that tlj is my single favorite film of all time the other close contenders being hot fuzz the social network and into the spiderverse and discussing it over the past few years has only cemented that in fact i give tlj and rian johnson a great deal of credit for the passion i have for filmmaking and tlj played a huge role in my decision to go back to college to major in filmmaking last year so to say this film is important to me is an understatement i could talk for hours and hours about the character arcs symbolism directors choices thematic resonance etc i say all this to really emphasize how near and dear to my heart this film is and to drive home how overly seriously i take discussing it  while my tendency to defend and lavish praise on this movie has admittedly been a bit silly and i can admit that im obsessive sometimes ive never felt like there was any moral issue with rushing to its defense from people criticizing it but that thought process was a bit shaken today and for the first time it felt like it came directly at odds with my desire to always empathize with and never invalidate the struggles that black people in the world are distraught over specifically in this case the pain that john felt over his experience with this franchise can already probably see where the cognitive dissonance hit me here how do i reconcile my bitterness about johns needlessly harsh words about a movie and a director that are both so inspiring to me with my desire to understand and acknowledge the very real pain hes feeling and has felt for years now whole day thoughts kept going through my head over ways to justify this surely he just misunderstood his own characters arc why is he seemingly throwing rian under the bus when logistically not much of the creative choices he hates can be attributed solely to rian his pain is real but his anger is just a bit misguided and id see other people including in this sub commenting stuff like hes just a narcissist he should be happy with what he got other actors didnt complain as much as this guy this is where i realized that these questions just didnt really matter right now and that his opinions on a movie were the least important things in that gq article i was spending all of this time trying to validate something that i liked over considering what john not finn had been through yes tlj is important to me and a lot of sw fans but our desire to validate our opinions on it shouldnt come at the expense of learning from a fellow human being who is using his voice to shine a light on a vile systemic problem that runs very very deep not just in hollywood but throughout the world  maybe the discussions about his takes on tlj or the st should wait and we should instead focus on how we can learn from his words on things that are more important we have our whole lives ahead of us to discuss our silly delightful space movies but the conversation that john is trying to spark is one thats much more important and the fact that people are already focusing on his creative disagreements instead is a bit concerning to me of us who arent poc should be instead looking at this and thinking about ifhow were contributing to the problem john described and if we are contributing to the problem then we should think about how we should change  me personally id like to be a filmmaker someday if you didnt already infer that from me saying that ive been going to film school chances are i wont ever be a big name in the industry or anything but i hope that im able to somehow use my talents someday in a way that uplift those less fortunate than i am and make them feel heard and valued as they should be im not really sure what that would look like for me just yet but its more important than arguing over johns words concerning a fictional character dont you think,0,4290,784,0,0.1,0.749,0.151,0.9924

The reviews seem mixed from what I've seen. I personally love them, and they do a great job of providing exposition and giving background to the New Republic and its many struggles.

It helps give background to Palpatines goals in the Unknown Region, shows how the New Republic handles warfare, and keeps us up to date with major characters...

...but my favorite part of the trilogy are the Interludes. Brief sections (every other chapter or so) that give a glimpse into one random location in the universe, and how they're dealing with the ""aftermath"" of the Galactic Civil War.

We see riots, protests, and gangs on all sides. Both Empire and Alliance trying to figure out what's next, and where they stand. We also see the media side of it, and how the media portrays the war to billions of people. 

Some don't know Palpatine is gone. Some don't even know how real of a person Luke is. Its so interesting to see the galaxy react to the downfall of the Empire, both positively and very, very negatively. It's ripe with politics, too!

Anyways....that was my rant. Worth a read if you care about understanding the time of the young New Republic, and how they turned into the pretty unhelpful political group they were around the time of the Sequels.

Thanks for reading!",StarWarsCantina,despite some mixedreviews i think the aftermath trilogy does a fantastic job of giving context and setting the stages for tbe post rotj universe potential mild spoilers reviews seem mixed from what ive seen i personally love them and they do a great job of providing exposition and giving background to the new republic and its many struggles helps give background to palpatines goals in the unknown region shows how the new republic handles warfare and keeps us up to date with major characters my favorite part of the trilogy are the interludes brief sections every other chapter or so that give a glimpse into one random location in the universe and how theyre dealing with the aftermath of the galactic civil war see riots protests and gangs on all sides both empire and alliance trying to figure out whats next and where they stand we also see the media side of it and how the media portrays the war to billions of people  dont know palpatine is gone some dont even know how real of a person luke is its so interesting to see the galaxy react to the downfall of the empire both positively and very very negatively its ripe with politics too was my rant worth a read if you care about understanding the time of the young new republic and how they turned into the pretty unhelpful political group they were around the time of the sequels for reading,0,1448,250,0,0.071,0.783,0.146,0.9706

1878,What are your predictions for what happens after The Rise of Skywalker?,0,ikv3cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/ikv3cy/what_are_your_predictions_for_what_happens_after/,15,1599030287.0,"Here’s my head canon/prediction of what happens

- I think Rey will be pregnant with twins. Ben Solos life force will create life within Rey, and they will be twins. This is why Rey buried Luke and Leias lightsabers, they will use those one day for themselves as Jedi. The twins will be the ultimate balance in the force, and this will bring the Skywalker story in full circle, beginning with Anakin being born of no father, and ending with the “Reylo twins” being born of no father and maintaining the balance. 

- Finn will reveal himself to Rey as force sensitive, and goes with Jannah and the rest of the runaway Stormtroopers to find their parents (I know Lando is Jannahs father). 

- The New Republic is reestablished, or perhaps a unified Galactic government. It seems the Galaxy has finally come together during the Battle of Exogol, they fought for themselves, they didn’t let a Rebellion or Empire decide their fate. This brings Anakins phrase to his Mother about nobody helping each other in full circle. 

- It seems that Poe will lead this new Republic, as he was Leias successor in Episode IX. Finn will be his top General, and also a high ranking official in the Republic. 

- Finn will recruit some force sensitive Stormtroopers to become Jedi in Rey’s new order.

- Rey, with her twins, will start a new Jedi order. Obviously different from last Jedi, being keepers of the peace, and letting the force sort things out as it intends to. Finn will take part in this new order too, perhaps training as a Jedi, Finns a busy man after Episode IX!

- Ben Solos force ghost will help his new family (Rey + twins) in starting the Jedi Order, righting his wrongs of destroying Luke’s order, and helping bring peace and justice to the Galaxy with his new family and their Jedi order. 

- I think Palpatine is gone for good, his Sith cult is gone too, maybe a Dark Empire esque story comes out where Rey (like Luke in Dark Empire) needs to confront him again, but I doubt it. I certainly believe one of the twins could be influenced by the dark (but redeemed), due to their lineage with Palpatine and the Skywalkers. 

- Rey will continue to be in contact with all the last Jedi, making her one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and giving her massive help in establishing the new order and righting the wrongs of the past Jedi. 

- Maybe a new villain/villains arise, but the force being balanced, Reys new family, and Poe’s unified Galaxy will quickly destroy them. 

- Overall, with Palpatine gone, Rey’s new family, the new Jedi order, Ben Solos ghost, Rey communing with past Jedi, Poes new unified Galaxy, and Finn doing all the things he’s doing, I think the Galaxy will become a peaceful place, and the Jedi will finally succeed in bringing peace to the Galaxy again, maybe for thousands of generations.

I am sharing it here because I want to demonstrate the awesome storytelling potential of the sequel era which has thus far only been explored in a fragmentary fashion (and I am secretly hoping someone at Lucasfilm somehow sees this). TCW did wonders for the prequel era, but it was set between AOTC and ROTS because that was the most pivotal time period. In the case of the sequels, the most pivotal time period is in fact the gap between ROTJ and TFA, or more precisely, between The Mandalorian and TFA, because Luke founded his temple a couple of years after the time frame of The Mandalorian. However, we shouldn't just want this show to go across that gap, it should continue past it and fill out the gap between TLJ and TROS, In essence, I want this show to go across the entire sequel era and run in parallel with all the movies too, showing the same events from different perspectives. The sequels are the conclusion of the Skywalker saga, and as such, this show could likewise be a giant conclusion, pulling in the story threads from all previous shows, The Mandalorian in particular, but also TCW, Rebels, and Resistance likewise. It could be grand, especially in light of TROS which brought the entire galaxy together against the Sith. That's an awesome story to explore. Anyways, here are my ideas...

**Season 1** - Luke and Ben are running around the galaxy as master and apprentice, exploring, solving problems, and helping people. They also by the end of the season begin gathering up the students and finally at the end, they form the temple. I would imagine this season would be relatively lighthearted, optimistic, and fun. This would be the most unusual animated season we've seen thus far. We would also explore Ben's relationship with his family before everything went sour, and the rebuilding of the Republic. The very last scene would depict the birth of Rey.

**Season 2** - Palpatine senses the birth of Rey as a disturbance in the Force and sends his agents out to hunt Rey's parents, and then we follow Rey's parents as they try to flee and lead more or less normal lives. I would make it so that Rey's mother was a Sith cultist who somehow fell in love with her father, who was as we now know a failed clone. I have a theory that The Child from The Mandalorian is somehow related to Rey's father and therefore Rey. I think the people who are really after him are the Sith cultists, and they want him in order to create a perfect host for Palpatine. At some point in The Mandalorian, they will either succeed in catching The Child, or at least holding him for enough time in order to extract useful info. If this turns out to be correct, there could be a direct connection between this season and the final outcome of The Mandalorian. We would also catch up on Ben, Luke, their students, and dive deeper into what is going on elsewhere in the galaxy.

**Season 3** - Rey's parents are now dead and she is left all alone. We would now follow Rey's childhood in tandem with Ben Solo's training and his experiences. Things would slowly start going sour for everyone, and cracks would begin to appear. Since the dyad in the Force predates TFA by years at the very least (we know now that Rey actually felt the exact moment when Ben fell to the dark side), you could even have Rey and Ben encounter each other in dreams, or feel each other's experiences subconsciously without even knowing it. Palpatine decides to give up the search in order to avoid being discovered, and he shifts his attention towards Ben Solo. Here, I would also like to introduce some friends and allies for Rey while she was on Jakku. She must have had some, as it didn't take her long to become friends with Finn, Han, and Chewie. How those friends would impact the story later on, I am not sure. Maybe should could end up reconnecting with them down the line.

**Season 4** - All is not well, Luke is sensing the coming darkness, but he proves incapable of handling it. Rey is now older and more experienced in survival, and Ben is beginning to grow alienated from everyone, Luke, his fellow students, his parents, and he is being ensnared by Palpatine. The season would end with the temple being destroyed and Ben fleeing in search of his new life. Luke of course goes into exile and we'd get to see how everyone reacted to that. Maybe it could also turn out that not all of Luke's students died in the end. That would be a good twist. As far as we know, all of them immediately died when the temple was destroyed, except for Ben and three others, Hennix, Tai and Voe. Those three died later too. But there's wiggle room here for retcons. If a retcon does happen, these lost Jedi could come into play later in creative ways, you'd just have to keep them away from the main characters or alternatively, do a hack like what they did with Ahsoka - it could be the case that they no longer consider themselves Jedi.

**Season 5** - This would be the most political season, as we would now explore the rise of the First Order in earnest, and how Leia was disgraced when it became public she was the daughter of Vader, and how she gathered the Resistance. We would also follow Kylo Ren and his adventures with the Knights of Ren as they enact their masters' bidding and set the stage for the coming war. Perhaps throw in an episode for Han and Chewie's adventures as smugglers and outlaws once again. The finale of this season would be taking place during the events of TFA and TLJ, because there is no time gap there. Perhaps here or in the earlier seasons, I would introduce a First Order stormtrooper character who was one of Finn's best friends and then when Finn turned into a traitor, this character grew very bitter and hateful towards Finn, and would become a recurring menace for the heroes.

**Season 6** - Here we would follow the first half of the war between the Resistance and the First Order (I propose that this war is called the ""Resurgence War"", because First Order-Resistance war really sounds lame in comparison to the Galactic Civil War and The Clone Wars). But there would be a unique spin on it - we wouldn't just follow the main group, but also other peoples and characters as they fight against the First Order too, and come to aid the Resistance when necessary. We would naturally also follow Leia training Rey, and there would be a special episode or two for when Leia discovers that Rey is a Palpatine. I really want to know how that happened and how Leia resolved to train her anyway. That was such a cool little piece of character development. I also want to know how exactly Kylo handled being Supreme Leader, because from how he handled himself in TROS. I would also be interested in exploring characters from all over canon here, especially old characters from TCW who are still around, like the pirate Hondo Ohnaka and clone trooper Kix. It was really weird to think that Rex was at Endor, but it's even weirder that Kix might have ended up on Exegol. If you are unaware, Kix actually spent decades in stasis after the Separatists kidnapped him in the waning days of the Clone Wars. The ship carrying him accidentally crashed on a far away planet and stayed there for decades until it was discovered by Sidon Ithano and his gang (the dude in the red helmet in TFA with whom Finn wanted to leave). As you might have noticed, that dude was with the Resistance in TROS like Maz Kanata too, and since Kix joined Ithano's gang before TFA, it's pretty possible that Kix was there too.

**Season 7** - Finally, the Resistance is gaining steam and the people of the galaxy are beginning to come together. There was a deleted scene at the start of TROS which would have clearly established this, but it was unfortunately cut. It's still canon though. When they were on Mustafar, Hux complained to Pryde that Kylo was busy chasing ghosts while flames of rebellion burn across the galaxy. Well, this season would be about truly showing that in action. Now, this is where that stormtrooper ex-friend of Finn would become very relevant. This is where we would bring everyone together truly. Something would happen that would cause the trooper to have a change of heart about Finn. Furthermore, at some point in this season, our main characters would go to Coruscant to seek allies, but they wouldn't succeed. However, ordinary people would be inspired by them anyway and this would eventually spiral into a full blown revolution. I would have Finn encounter some fellow stormtroopers and inspire them to reject the Order, and then in the following episodes, Finn's friend and they would end up becoming the leaders of the revolution, inspired by Finn the Traitor who became a Hero. As Lando and Chewie were sent to the Core Worlds to gather the allies of the Resistance. Coruscant would be the flashpoint of the galaxy-wide uprising against the First Order and that would feed directly into the finale of TROS when the fleet shows up.

**Epilogue** - One thing I would also like to see, perhaps as its own season, is an epilogue story taking place years after TROS and the finale of the show on Coruscant. Seeing what became of all our favorite characters would be so lovely and it would be a perfect way to finally wrap up the Skywalker saga. There could be any number of things to put here, but I would be really keen on seeing Rey training new Jedi with Finn, Poe becoming Chancellor of the New Republic, Rose becoming an admiral, and the galaxy entering into a new age of true peace and cooperation.",StarWarsCantina,my outline for a sequel tcwstyle show an outline or a wishlist i dont know what to call it i am sharing it here because i want to demonstrate the awesome storytelling potential of the sequel era which has thus far only been explored in a fragmentary fashion and i am secretly hoping someone at lucasfilm somehow sees this tcw did wonders for the prequel era but it was set between aotc and rots because that was the most pivotal time period in the case of the sequels the most pivotal time period is in fact the gap between rotj and tfa or more precisely between the mandalorian and tfa because luke founded his temple a couple of years after the time frame of the mandalorian however we shouldnt just want this show to go across that gap it should continue past it and fill out the gap between tlj and tros in essence i want this show to go across the entire sequel era and run in parallel with all the movies too showing the same events from different perspectives the sequels are the conclusion of the skywalker saga and as such this show could likewise be a giant conclusion pulling in the story threads from all previous shows the mandalorian in particular but also tcw rebels and resistance likewise it could be grand especially in light of tros which brought the entire galaxy together against the sith thats an awesome story to explore anyways here are my ideas 1  luke and ben are running around the galaxy as master and apprentice exploring solving problems and helping people they also by the end of the season begin gathering up the students and finally at the end they form the temple i would imagine this season would be relatively lighthearted optimistic and fun this would be the most unusual animated season weve seen thus far we would also explore bens relationship with his family before everything went sour and the rebuilding of the republic the very last scene would depict the birth of rey 2  palpatine senses the birth of rey as a disturbance in the force and sends his agents out to hunt reys parents and then we follow reys parents as they try to flee and lead more or less normal lives i would make it so that reys mother was a sith cultist who somehow fell in love with her father who was as we now know a failed clone i have a theory that the child from the mandalorian is somehow related to reys father and therefore rey i think the people who are really after him are the sith cultists and they want him in order to create a perfect host for palpatine at some point in the mandalorian they will either succeed in catching the child or at least holding him for enough time in order to extract useful info if this turns out to be correct there could be a direct connection between this season and the final outcome of the mandalorian we would also catch up on ben luke their students and dive deeper into what is going on elsewhere in the galaxy 3  reys parents are now dead and she is left all alone we would now follow reys childhood in tandem with ben solos training and his experiences things would slowly start going sour for everyone and cracks would begin to appear since the dyad in the force predates tfa by years at the very least we know now that rey actually felt the exact moment when ben fell to the dark side you could even have rey and ben encounter each other in dreams or feel each others experiences subconsciously without even knowing it palpatine decides to give up the search in order to avoid being discovered and he shifts his attention towards ben solo here i would also like to introduce some friends and allies for rey while she was on jakku she must have had some as it didnt take her long to become friends with finn han and chewie how those friends would impact the story later on i am not sure maybe should could end up reconnecting with them down the line 4  all is not well luke is sensing the coming darkness but he proves incapable of handling it rey is now older and more experienced in survival and ben is beginning to grow alienated from everyone luke his fellow students his parents and he is being ensnared by palpatine the season would end with the temple being destroyed and ben fleeing in search of his new life luke of course goes into exile and wed get to see how everyone reacted to that maybe it could also turn out that not all of lukes students died in the end that would be a good twist as far as we know all of them immediately died when the temple was destroyed except for ben and three others hennix tai and voe those three died later too but theres wiggle room here for retcons if a retcon does happen these lost jedi could come into play later in creative ways youd just have to keep them away from the main characters or alternatively do a hack like what they did with ahsoka  it could be the case that they no longer consider themselves jedi 5  this would be the most political season as we would now explore the rise of the first order in earnest and how leia was disgraced when it became public she was the daughter of vader and how she gathered the resistance we would also follow kylo ren and his adventures with the knights of ren as they enact their masters bidding and set the stage for the coming war perhaps throw in an episode for han and chewies adventures as smugglers and outlaws once again the finale of this season would be taking place during the events of tfa and tlj because there is no time gap there perhaps here or in the earlier seasons i would introduce a first order stormtrooper character who was one of finns best friends and then when finn turned into a traitor this character grew very bitter and hateful towards finn and would become a recurring menace for the heroes 6  here we would follow the first half of the war between the resistance and the first order i propose that this war is called the resurgence war because first orderresistance war really sounds lame in comparison to the galactic civil war and the clone wars but there would be a unique spin on it  we wouldnt just follow the main group but also other peoples and characters as they fight against the first order too and come to aid the resistance when necessary we would naturally also follow leia training rey and there would be a special episode or two for when leia discovers that rey is a palpatine i really want to know how that happened and how leia resolved to train her anyway that was such a cool little piece of character development i also want to know how exactly kylo handled being supreme leader because from how he handled himself in tros i would also be interested in exploring characters from all over canon here especially old characters from tcw who are still around like the pirate hondo ohnaka and clone trooper kix it was really weird to think that rex was at endor but its even weirder that kix might have ended up on exegol if you are unaware kix actually spent decades in stasis after the separatists kidnapped him in the waning days of the clone wars the ship carrying him accidentally crashed on a far away planet and stayed there for decades until it was discovered by sidon ithano and his gang the dude in the red helmet in tfa with whom finn wanted to leave as you might have noticed that dude was with the resistance in tros like maz kanata too and since kix joined ithanos gang before tfa its pretty possible that kix was there too 7  finally the resistance is gaining steam and the people of the galaxy are beginning to come together there was a deleted scene at the start of tros which would have clearly established this but it was unfortunately cut its still canon though when they were on mustafar hux complained to pryde that kylo was busy chasing ghosts while flames of rebellion burn across the galaxy well this season would be about truly showing that in action now this is where that stormtrooper exfriend of finn would become very

This is a movie I saw purely out of curiosity, at the time I wasn't really interested in the sequel trilogy as The Force Awakens really disappointed me so I had no plans to see it. After the insane backlash I was quite curious why this movie was receiving so much hate, since I was really sick at the time I couldn't go see it so I watched spoiler videos instead and I still couldn't understand the immense hate. After I started to feel better I went to see it in theaters and was surprised by how much I liked it. There were so many things that genuinely shocked me even though I had seen spoiler videos it couldn't compare to actually seeing it. After The Last Jedi I started to really get into Star Wars and Kylo Ren became my favorite fictional character this movie really sparked my love for Star Wars. Anyway now that you know my backstory with this movie let me get into my actual review. I think the opening with Poe while fun is probably the weakest opening in the sequel trilogy, the transition to Finn asking where Rey is to it cutting to Ach-too is pretty great but I'm not sure why they needed to recreate the moment she walks up the steps it could've just cut to her waiting for Luke's answer with her hand outstretched. Luke chucking the lightsaber is amazing and never fails to get a laugh out of me grumpy Luke is my favorite, again the transition when Luke says ""Where's Han""? And it cuts to Kylo is masterful. Speaking of I love every single thing having to do with Kylo, Rian took a really evil guy in TFA and made us care for him and of course Adam Driver nails it. Rey's and Kylo's relationship is so interesting everytime they force connect are some of the best parts of the movie as is her relationship with Luke. Now let's get to the controversial stuff which is Rose and Canto Bight. Personally while I don't really mind Rose I don't really like her either definitely one my least favorite SW characters. Canto Bight is all right but it goes on way too long and feels really goofy it doesn't match the tone with the rest of the movie at all. Also I feel like Finn doesn't really have anything to do it feels like he's kind of along with the ride it should have been him to break them out of prison, speaking of I don't know why people complain so much about Rose when D.J. is there. I legitimately can't stand him and I have no idea why he has a weird and frankly offensive stutter it makes no sense that they would find ANOTHER master code breaker in the same prison they're in Justin Theroux should've remained the code breaker D.J. was totally unnecessary.  Another controversial aspect is Holdo and her subplot with Poe which I actually love, Holdo's a badass and it makes complete sense for her to not tell Poe the plan since he's so unpredictable. Arguably the best part of the movie is the throne room scene my jaw dropped when Kylo killed Snoke the way it was done was so cool and seeing it for the first time is an experience I'll never get again it was just so cool same thing with Holdo going into lightspeed the cinematography in that scene is Chefs kiss and my whole audience gasped. Everything on Crait is really great although I hate Rose ramming into Finn and that awful kiss they have zero chemistry and it feels so out of place. Luke showing up is amazing and his whole interaction with Kylo is awesome. His death even now moves me I honestly think he got the best death in Star Wars it was exactly how I wanted him to go peacefully and with purpose as Rey puts it.

It all has to do with essence transfer. 

Either it's general knowledge of the Sith, taught to him by Darth plaguius, or Palpatine learned it on his own, Palpatine learned essence transfer. 

So how does essence transfer work? Well here's how I believe it works, and I based it off of the movies PLUS some info from Legends. While legends isn't canon, some information lines up perfectly with it. 

""The power enabled the wielder's spirit to survive the death of their organic body by usurping control of a suitable receptacle. If the invading consciousness was powerful enough, it could override and expel the mind of the target body."" 

- Wookipedia

Okay cool pretty straight forward. But here where it gets tricky. I believe that essence transfer works one of two ways.  The first is that the user can transfer to inanimate objects before death. We've already seen this before. The other is based off of legends. ""Suitable receptacle"". 

What is a suitable receptacle? Well picture you have the ability to transfer to any body in the world. Would you pick a host that was weak? A host that, their mind, was too strong and instead expelled you?

It's pretty obvious. You want an able body, one connected to the force, and one that won't expell you. 

However to transfer to a body one of the following must be true. The body you are transferring to must be dead OR the body is alive and well BUT the original host of the body must be in an extreme emotional state from an act that requires one to be ""weakend"" in the force. Preferably through sin, and no sin is greater than murder. 

Enter the chosen one: Anakin Skywalker. This is the perfect host body for Palpatine, until Vader became a walking iron lung. Palpatine doesn't want to live that way, and he doesn't want to die, he wants to rule forever. He is the ultimate bad guy after all. 

So what's a sith to do? Find a more perfect host. And he did! Luke Skywalker. 

Unfortunately Luke is a Jedi, like his father before him. Vader throws Papa Palpatine down a shaft and he explodes. Explodes? 

Well according to Legends, ""Attempting it will cause the current vessel to be destroyed; your body will be consumed by the power of the dark side.""

Interesting, Palpatine is clearly shown exploding, being destroyed, consumed by the power of the dark side. 

So what now? 

Well it stands to reason, now that the Kamino no longer clone for the Empire, it was up to the sith to prepare in advance. 

Wait, you thought Palpatine was actually waiting for a suitable host like Luke? I lied. Palpatine had clones at the ready, in case Vader died, killed him, or it was just time for Palpatine to die. 

It stands to reason that not all clones are force sensitive, I believe that any of Palpatines clones that were not force sensitive were just used to help rebuild the Empire in the form of the Final Order. 

Meanwhile a perfect suitable clone body was created, killed, and immediately placed in stasis to preserve the body. 

Upon Palpatines death, he transfered to the dead body. This explains why Palpatine looks so, dead in ROS. It was already a dead body. He's just possessing it. 

Now Palpatine must go with his backup plan. Restore the Empire at all cost. 

For this next segment we divide this in four Snoke/Skywalker, Ben Solo, Rey, and how it all ties together perfectly. 

Let's go in order shall we.

Not debating how Snoke was formed or anything. But he is now serving Palpatine. Snoke is told his goals are clear, kill Skywalker. Train Ben Solo. The reason I believe it is hinted in The last Jedi that snoke is serving Palpatine is because of the guards. They are cloaked in red, just like the Sith troopers, and you know Palpatine likes red. Not very subtle about it just look at his office as Chancellor of the Republic.

Anyways, Palpatine is already poisoning the mind of young Ben solo for his benefit ever since he could. 

Palpatine cannot kill Skywalker. He's already too weak, hooked up to a machine to allow himself to live. As for creating another clone? Nah, he wants Ben. That's all that matters to him. A new host. 

Ben Solo is the perfect target. He has that Skywalker blood in him. If he could be turned to the dark side he would be a useful tool, a useful asset, and a useful vessel. A strong mind of a Jedi would simply expel Palpatine before the ritual could be completed.  He must be turned. 

it's later discovered that one of the clones that was not force sensitive had escape the Sith eternal. Falling in love with some girl. Yeah that will do it to ya. 

Palpatine orders his death, and later learns that the clone and the woman have a child. 

The hubris of Palpatine allowed him to not be worried about this child, so long as she is gone and dropped off some planet some wasteland in the middle of nowhere, then she isn't a problem whatsoever. (Or he may not have known about Rey. I will need to rewatch ROS again just in case)

So exactly how does this all tie together? 

First palpatine's only concern is that snoke continues to train Kylo Ren. When the time comes kylo Ren is to kill snoke, and Palpatine will reveal himself and demand kylo Ren perform the ritual. After all, how can you have an Empire when someone's already stronger than you why not kill them? That's the plan when Kylo is strong enough with the force, commits murder, his mind and emotions will be unstable. A perfect time to become a vessel. 

With kylo Ren being so young, Palpatine could never turn this down. He would get to live quite sometime before needing a new host body. 

But then comes Rey and everything changes. Snoke is informed that not even the mighty kylo Ren himself could defeat her. Snoke informs Palpatine and a new plan is formed.

Kill the girl. No matter what.  This is why snoke insist to kylo Ren that he must bring the girl to him. 

Snoke learns that they have something, he senses it in the force. A Dyad. A bond. He helps to strengthen it, with the hopes she will want to help Kylo. If she does, it'll be easier to bring her before Snoke.  Snoke doesnt inform Palpatine about the Dyad. Which is why Palpatine is so shocked about it. Why bother informing him anyways? All that matters is that she dies. 

Some people say Snokes throne room is like a theater, Palpatine loves theater, and was watching from afar. Perhaps it's true, maybe. 

Regardless, Kylo kills Snoke. This is exactly what Palpatine wanted. Except one problem. The girl still lives. 

Palpatine senses something. Skywalker is dead. Sure the girl lives, but now is the time to announce to the Galaxy (through Fortnite lol) that the great error is to be corrected! 

When kylo meets Palpatine, Palpatine tells kylo he will have everything, he must kill the girl. The way Palpatine sees it, he only needs one host body. Get rid of anything that challenges him. 

But kylo dies and Ben is restored. Palpatine has one trick up his sleeve. 

Once long ago he promised Luke Skywalker that to save  his friends he must kill his father. Take his place as the new apprentice to the dark lord. 

Palpatine believes this trick will work, Rey will become his new body, and Ben will die.

However just in time, Ben arrives. 

They decided to stand together. Because of this, they wouldn't be murdering Palpatine. They would be justified in their actions, and justified through the force. Essence transfer would not work. 

So instead Palpatine wants them to die together. Palpatine goes for the kill through the force and guess what happens instead, he's shocked. Surprised! 

The dyad of their bond, it is restoring life to the corpse he is possessing. Thus allowing him to live once more. if Palpatine can live just a little longer perhaps he can create more clone bodies or find a new host that is not Rey or Ben. 

Unfortunately for Palpatine he is destroyed along with the Sith Eternal.  

The rebirth of Palpatine has been hinted at far longer than the rise of Skywalker, we were just not given the final puzzles. This is the ultimate bad guy of Star Wars after all, he has a back up plans for the back plans he made for back up plans. 


TL;Dr : ST makes a bit more sense now because Papa palps ain't giving up and cheats death.",StarWarsCantina,"palpatines return fits perfectly the previous movies act as subtle hints before his broadcas and theres one neat detail about palpatine and guess what it all has to do with essence transfer  its general knowledge of the sith taught to him by darth plaguius or palpatine learned it on his own palpatine learned essence transfer  how does essence transfer work well heres how i believe it works and i based it off of the movies plus some info from legends while legends isnt canon some information lines up perfectly with it  power enabled the wielders spirit to survive the death of their organic body by usurping control of a suitable receptacle if the invading consciousness was powerful enough it could override and expel the mind of the target body  wookipedia cool pretty straight forward but here where it gets tricky i believe that essence transfer works one of two ways  the first is that the user can transfer to inanimate objects before death weve already seen this before the other is based off of legends suitable receptacle  is a suitable receptacle well picture you have the ability to transfer to any body in the world would you pick a host that was weak a host that their mind was too strong and instead expelled you pretty obvious you want an able body one connected to the force and one that wont expell you  to transfer to a body one of the following must be true the body you are transferring to must be dead or the body is alive and well but the original host of the body must be in an extreme emotional state from an act that requires one to be weakend in the force preferably through sin and no sin is greater than murder  the chosen one anakin skywalker this is the perfect host body for palpatine until vader became a walking iron lung palpatine doesnt want to live that way and he doesnt want to die he wants to rule forever he is the ultimate bad guy after all  whats a sith to do find a more perfect host and he did luke skywalker  luke is a jedi like his father before him vader throws papa palpatine down a shaft and he explodes explodes  according to legends attempting it will cause the current vessel to be destroyed your body will be consumed by the power of the dark side palpatine is clearly shown exploding being destroyed consumed by the power of the dark side  what now  it stands to reason now that the kamino no longer clone for the empire it was up to the sith to prepare in advance  you thought palpatine was actually waiting for a suitable host like luke i lied palpatine had clones at the ready in case vader died killed him or it was just time for palpatine to die  stands to reason that not all clones are force sensitive i believe that any of palpatines clones that were not force sensitive were just used to help rebuild the empire in the form of the final order  a perfect suitable clone body was created killed and immediately placed in stasis to preserve the body  palpatines death he transfered to the dead body this explains why palpatine looks so dead in ros it was already a dead body hes just possessing it  palpatine must go with his backup plan restore the empire at all cost  this next segment we divide this in four snokeskywalker ben solo rey and how it all ties together perfectly  go in order shall we debating how snoke was formed or anything but he is now serving palpatine snoke is told his goals are clear kill skywalker train ben solo the reason i believe it is hinted in the last jedi that snoke is serving palpatine is because of the guards they are cloaked in red just like the sith troopers and you know palpatine likes red not very subtle about it just look at his office as chancellor of the republic palpatine is already poisoning the mind of young ben solo for his benefit ever since he could  cannot kill skywalker hes already too weak hooked up to a machine to allow himself to live as for creating another clone nah he wants ben thats all that matters to him a new host  solo is the perfect target he has that skywalker blood in him if he could be turned to the dark side he would be a useful tool a useful asset and a useful vessel a strong mind of a jedi would simply expel palpatine before the ritual could be completed  he must be turned  later discovered that one of the clones that was not force sensitive had escape the sith eternal falling in love with some girl yeah that will do it to ya  orders his death and later learns that the clone and the woman have a child  hubris of palpatine allowed him to not be worried about this child so long as she is gone and dropped off some planet some wasteland in the middle of nowhere then she isnt a problem whatsoever or he may not have known about rey i will need to rewatch ros again just in case exactly how does this all tie together  palpatines only concern is that snoke continues to train kylo ren when the time comes kylo ren is to kill snoke and palpatine will reveal himself and demand kylo ren perform the ritual after all how can you have an empire when someones already stronger than you why

I have always felt that legends had the highest highs and the lowest lows for me personally, the force unleashed is one of my favorite stories while the force unleashed 2 is one of my least favorite (it just felt a bit forced (reading back over this before posting I would like to apologize, that pun was completely unintentional))

Meanwhile canon seems more consistent, things range from alright to really good but don't quite hit the exceptional levels as say Knights of the Old Republic which had some amazing world building that has yet to be matched

Overall I don't have a preferred timeline but I do think that if we took all the good stories and transferred them over and kept bringing in the smaller things (for example the TIE Phantom was brought back along with many of its details according to wookieepedia) but I do think there are some boundaries and rules I would set bringing this content over

For example 

* The content should be spread out, giving us all my favorite stories at once and not giving us anything new would be like if we got a new halo game where all the multiplayer maps would be our favorites brought over, it would be cool but I like having original things
* The content would be reworked to fit canon, no canon stuff would be reworked to accommodate the legends material unless it was something very small that would help greatly, also having the legends material changed to fit into canon would make it feel more at home here, for example the planet  Dromund Kaas could maybe become Exigul? Possibly? I don't know quite enough about that era to know if that would work but you get the idea
* A few other basic rules like no sith lord should surpass Palpatine in power, I've always felt like Palpatine was the end result of a thousand years of sith growing stronger and deserves that title and some other things to help keep things from spinning into insanity 

So in short I would like recanonized stories to be a side thing that we get drip fed overtime through video game remakes, comics and TV shows so that the new canon still gets the resources to grow and we can get interesting new stories but those are just my thoughts and I'm interested in what the people here have to say, just remember to keep it civil...or I will come for you",StarWarsCantina,"so whats the general consensus of this subreddit in regards to bringing legends material back into canon ive been meaning to ask in this subreddit especially because unlike other subs there is a lot more enthusiasm about the new canonin fact its the only one where i feel 100 safe talking about why i loved the sequels so naturally it seems more likely for there to be a more interesting conversation with less arguing   have always felt that legends had the highest highs and the lowest lows for me personally the force unleashed is one of my favorite stories while the force unleashed 2 is one of my least favorite it just felt a bit forced reading back over this before posting i would like to apologize that pun was completely unintentional canon seems more consistent things range from alright to really good but dont quite hit the exceptional levels as say knights of the old republic which had some amazing world building that has yet to be matched i dont have a preferred timeline but i do think that if we took all the good stories and transferred them over and kept bringing in the smaller things for example the tie phantom was brought back along with many of its details according to wookieepedia but i do think there are some boundaries and rules i would set bringing this content over example  the content should be spread out giving us all my favorite stories at once and not giving us anything new would be like if we got a new halo game where all the multiplayer maps would be our favorites brought over it would be cool but i like having original things

I have had several heated arguments about how Luke was ruined and how Rey is a Mary Sue.  However, in rewatching the sequels, I have been reminded of a quote which I have always held firm to (rather hypocritically as of late).


“I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.” - J. R. R. Tolkien, Afterward of The Fellowship of the Ring.

I pride myself on being an, as of yet, amateur writer with a decent level of skill, and I have always praised Tolkien for his philosophical works on writing and fantasy.  Namely, Tolkien believed in a loosely built world where interpretations are subject to the reader rather than the author.  In rewatching the sequels, I have found many areas where one can apply this freedom of interpretation and see the hidden beauty of the films.  For instance, Rey touches Anakin’s lightsaber and in the process of her vision, she hears Ewan Mcgregor’s Obi-Wan say, “these are your first steps.”  Later in the film, we see her display the first force power ever displayed in Star Wars as Rey bends the mind of ~~James Bond~~ a stormtrooper.  Taken separately, this looks like lazy writing, but taken together in the context of a fluid narrative, I believe now that Rey learned that power from Obi-Wan himself.

My previously biggest qualm with the sequels has always been the presentation of Luke.  While I still think the old master was mishandled (Kylo should have turned despite Luke’s persistent help, not due to Luke’s actions out of fear) I do see the respect which Johnson has for the character.  

I have nothing to say about the canto bite sequence, it still sucks.  If you like it, great, but otherwise I still hate it.

The thing which the sequels do phenomenally is the display of the force.  I’m glad that the creators took advantage of the technology, because seeing Jedi fly around and control blaster bolts was just a treat.  Each trilogy has its strength (the OT has the best story, the PT has the best choreographed lightsaber fights) and the force definitely belongs to the ST.

Looking back at my old assumption about the trilogy, I see that I let the same sort of snobbishness come over me which pervades the amateur (and often the professional) viewing audience.  With the internet, everyone can become a critic, and that provides for the more spoiled viewers who like everything explained up front to put their word in.  Rewatching the prequels has really taught me something, there’s always more than meets the eye, and I shouldn’t expect to be spoon-fed character details.  Maybe it’s a lesson we all could learn, to let our imagination run wild.

I know that this is a Star Wars sub, but since I started with a quote form Tolkien, I wanted to end with one, because I think it’s pertinent to the discussion.


“Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike being “arrested.” They dislike any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them. They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with Dreaming, in which there is no Art; and with mental disorders, in which there is not even control: with delusion and hallucination.” - J.

While ROTJ is largely beloved, it does have a rather vocal and ardent group of naysayers online; some of which go so far as to say ROTJ is one of the worst films in the franchise.

There is a certain attitude that slinks around the fandom that **Return of the Jedi** marks the “beginning of the downfall” of Star Wars. The reasoning for this mindset in multifaceted. Many claim this was when Lucas made it clear he cared more about toys and marketing than the art of storytelling (Which is just silly – Uncle George jumped on that train from the very beginning). They hinge this incredibly cynical accusation simply because of the Ewoks – who were basically Jar Jar before Jar Jar.

They decry the films supposed laziness in writing by returning to Tatooine, bringing back the Death Star, and smoothing the edges off Han Solo, and sloppily making Leia and Luke siblings when it was hilariously obvious they weren’t.

They bemoan the films tone as childish and goofy due to the abundance of puppetry and the Ewoks. And they will never let it go that Boba Fett went out like a chump, even though he wasn’t much of a character to begin with.

I may sound rather flip and dismissive of these points, but that isn’t my intention (although I disagree with every single one of them) at all. There are valid reasons to criticize Return of the Jedi, just as there are valid reasons to criticize every film in the entire franchise. I just feel that ROTJ makes a convenient scapegoat for a certain kind of Star Wars fan that is all too common, and I think it’s bogus.

I’m not here to try and make some quasi-authoritative analysis of ROTJ. I just want to write about my favorite Star Wars movie with no attempt at hiding my bias. I love all three OT films equally for the most part, and my more “Serious Movie Critics Brain” can concede that maybe A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are better constructed films narratively speaking, I just can’t shake the *feelings* Return of the Jedi gives me every single time I watch it.

When people say the words “Star Wars,” images, scenes, and sounds from THIS film are what pop into my head first.

I agree with some of the common complaints about the film. I do think the films structure is a bit lopsided. The first act is too long and the second act is too short. Many fans complain the film just spends too much time on Tatooine. I get it. But do I care? Do I agree? Not really. They spend roughly the same amount of time on Hoth in *Empire*, so why is it such a big deal in *ROTJ*? You could argue that it’s not the same because Hoth ends up directly tying into the plot of the film with the Empire attacking, while rescuing Han is a side question not related to the overall story.

Bunk to that I say. Rescuing Han IS part of the main story. I don’t care that Ford wanted Han to die, that’s not narratively satisfying. To have Luke and Leia not try to save him would be a massive misstep. The entire series is about friendship, connection, and love. The Han rescue is no different than any other time our heroes went out of their way to save a friend.

The Tatooine sequence is pure movie magic to me. It’s a movie within a movie. It’s everything I love about Star Wars condensed into the opening act of a film. It’s weird. It’s silly. It’s adventurous. The pure imagination on display in the Jabba Palace segment is the height of movie making in my opinion. The film so effortlessly plunges you into this weird, dangerous world.

I feel that ROTJ best captures that tone of old serials Lucas was heavily inspired by. It’s high adventure in the most purely cinematic clothing ever – dashing heroes, nefarious villains. It’s wondrous. It’s Star Wars.

What I also enjoy about the film so much is the sense of togetherness it displays. Our heroes are united as one with a common goal. They have all embraced their roles in the Rebellion and their own personal destiny. The Rebellion itself is depicted as strong and confident. They feel like a true movement in ROTJ, moreso than in the last two films where they were running and scrambling. The overall positivity of the film is very enjoyable.

Which leads me to Han. One of the biggest criticisms of the film is that they took the edge off Han and that he doesn’t have anything to do. Some even claim he should have died for real to give the film “more stakes.” I find this cynical and antithetical to the overall themes and messages of the film and the trilogy as a whole.

Han has plenty to do. He has finally embrace being a Rebel with a cause, a man not just fighting for himself or for his friends - but for the great good (Finn’s arc mirrors Han’s in this regard). He’s still acerbic, still wry, and sarcastic. But he finally let his guard down and taken up a leadership role he’s been pushing against since **A New Hope**.

So no, Han wasn’t “wasted with nothing to do.” This is Han fully formed into a better man.

I personally love seeing the “softer” Han. I think it’s a great finish for his character in the OT.

The second half of the film is a perfect marriage of spectacle and high drama. While some aspects of the action scenes have aged a little more poorly than stuff in the previous films (the speeder bike chase comes to mind) it’s all still designed and executed to the highest standard. This height of craft and execution makes it easy to overlook some dated shots in the speeder chase, or some obvious stop motion in the AT-ST assault, because it’s so well done otherwise.

I can safely say I think ROTJ has the best action in the OT, and still some of the very best action in the entire saga. There is a reason the space battle is still championed. It’s incredible. The fact that it’s all practical makes it even more impressive as it ages instead of dating it. No matter how many times I watch the film, I’m still in awe of what ILM accomplished.

My favorite part of the space battle in the Falcon’s descent into the bowels of the Death Star 2. Everything about that segment hits my buttons. I love the impossibly large scale of the innards of the space station – the endless passages or tubes and ports whizzing by as the Falcon races towards the center. It’s all so visually striking a fun inversion of the trench run in ANH.

In fact, everything pertaining the to Death Star 2 may be my favorite bit of effects magic in the entire saga.

What of the Battle of Endor?

Oh boy. Are we sick of talking about Ewoks yet? To be fair, the hate for them has muted somewhat. But people still hate them and bitch about them whenever they get the chance. I loved them as a kid. I still love them now. I just don’t see the problem. The way some fans go on about them, you would think the Care Bears suddenly found their way into the SWU.

Yeah, sure. They’re *kinda* cutesy – but how cutesy is REALLY overblown if you ask me. The Ewoks are a pretty well developed alien society given they only appear in the last act of the last film in the trilogy. You get to know their customs, their temperament, their sense of community and honor. They aren’t just a pair of cute eyes and soft fur. They are violent. They are crafty. They can kill you and eat you.

The other nonstop complaint about the Ewoks is the beyond tired “Omg I can’t believe a group of savage teddy bears can beat the Empire! So stupid!”

The Ewoks didn’t beat “The Empire.” The Ewoks had HELP from the Rebellion in taking out a platoon or regiment or whatever you want to call it so the Rebels could complete their mission. So this ever so stale narrative that the “Ewoks beat the Empire” is flat out false. In fact, if you actually pay attention, the Ewoks get their furry little rumps handed to them by the Empire for the first half of the battle. It’s not until Chewie and Wicket steal an AT-ST and start blasting away that the tide of the battle turns for the Ewoks.

Yes, we all want to see the version of the film where it was Wookies instead of Ewoks. You can choose to say Lucas is lying when he said casting and creating all of the Wookies was too much of a logistical hassle or you can choose to believe him. It doesn’t really matter. We have the Ewoks and they serve the same purpose the Wookies would have. Just in a smaller package.

I could go into the Throne Room stuff with Luke, Vader, and The Emperor but I don’t think I need to. It’s the most praised aspect of the film. What I will say is that Luke in ROTJ is still my favorite depiction of a Jedi in the films.

I love his cool and collected exterior. I love his sense of compassion. I love his flirtations with the Dark Side that are never explicit until he loses it on Vader for threatening Leia. I love how he grew beyond the teaching of Yoda and Obi Wan to become his own Jedi with his own sense of what becoming one means to him.

And I’m a goddamn sucker for green lightsabers. I love green lightsabers.

In summary, Return of the Jedi is every bit the Star Wars film its predecessors are, but due to circumstances beyond its existence, I feel that it has been the target of unfairly jaded takes over the years. Which brings me to my next argument.

&#x200B;

The Early Beginnings of The Fandom Menace

&#x200B;

It seems that online at least, **literally everyone** has an opinion about Star Wars. And everyone is going to make sure that their opinion is seen and validated by as many people as possible. I’m no different. I did just spent a few hours typing up over 2,000 words probably only a few people will read (if I'm lucky) with my mediocre ramblings.

Star Wars, by virtue of its own massive success, became something other than a series of well-liked films. People treat them like gospel, like a bible. There are movies, **and then there is Star Wars**. Due to that love being so all-consuming, the ownership a fan feels over it makes them feel superior, makes them feel like they have it all figured out and everyone else is wrong. When a movie or show or book or whatever comes that they don’t like, they take it as a personal attack. They see it as an affront to their taste, their understanding, and their brand loyalty.

*“How could Lucas/Disney do this to ME?”*

That’s why you see endless YT videos with pseudo-intellectual talking points explaining how fundamentally broken the ST is. That’s why the PT was a laughing stock for over a decade until the haters moved on to the ST. That’s why people feel they have the right to insult you and challenge your intelligence over liking or disliking a damn movie.

*“This is how I feel about Star Wars. And because I am a REAL FAN, I get to dictate my OBJECTIVE opinion onto others and surround myself with like-minded people who only serve to inflate my false sense of critical superiority.”*

I didn’t mean for this to get so heavy, but I feel that this particular contingent of fans who dislike ROTJ were kind of the beginning of The Fandom Menace, or more accurately  - the beginning of the attitude TFM exudes. Suddenly, the conversation wasn’t “I like all three, but Jedi is the weakest.” Or “I love all three equally.” The conversation turned more bitter, angry, and aggressive when the Special Editions came out.

The way see it (which I acknowledge is purely my own subjective perception)  ROTJ went from being accepted whole-heartedly as the final film in the trilogy to the root of all evil that the SW franchise would become. The criticism of ROTJ may seem mild compared to the volume of hate the PT had and the ST is having...and it is. But the hate that is there is just as strong as it is with the PT and OT. It's not uncommon to see ""purists"" lamenting that Star Wars should have ended in 1980 or that there hasn't been a truly good Star Wars film since 1980.

**And just so nobody gets the wrong idea**, **I'm NOT saying people who dislike or criticize ROTJ are Fandom Menace. I'm not saying people need to like the film or are wrong for disliking it or seeing it as the weakest of the OT. It's totally fine to feel however you feel about it.**

I’m merely hypothesizing that some of the attitudes present in TFM go back to the shift in perspective some fans had for ROTJ in the 90s. If somebody thought ROTJ was the weakest, then that was that. It's wasn't anything deeper. They still loved it. It was still Star Wars. And it was embraced just like ANH and ESB.

George Lucas was nerd Jesus for decades. Then the cracks began to show when fans were displeased with the Special Editions and Lucas’s refusal to properly release the original versions. The Lucas hate only intensified when the PT was coming out. He went from Messiah to Devil in the span of a decade.

I don't think I can stress enough for younger fans just how intense the hatred for Lucas was for a very, very long time. While it wasn't as widespread as online hatred is now due to conversations being relegated to forums and chats, the hatred was indeed omnipresent in the fandom. People felt personally, viscerally betrayed by Lucas for the changes he made to the OT and for the prequels.

Now, ironically, the people who called for his head are praying for his return.

The passion fans have for this universe is as much a curse as it is something special. I don’t care how much you worship these movies. I don’t care how much you separate Star Wars from all other film as that special something. At the end of the day, they are still JUST. MOVIES. I feel confident saying this because I also feel that special way about Star Wars. It IS special. It IS it’s own thing to me. But I can still separate my devotion to it and see the reality of it: They’re just movies, guys. They’re just freaking movies.",StarWarsCantina,return of the jedi  an unnecessary defense and the early days of the fandom menace warning long read ahead rotj is largely beloved it does have a rather

inversion of the trench run in anh fact everything pertaining the to death star 2 may be my favorite bit of effects magic in the entire saga of the battle of endor boy are we sick of talking about ewoks yet to be fair the hate for them has muted somewhat but people still hate them and bitch about them whenever they get the chance i loved them as a kid i still love them now i just don’t see the problem the way some fans go on about them you would think the care bears suddenly found their way into the swu sure they’re kinda cutesy – but how cutesy is really overblown if you ask me the ewoks are a pretty well developed alien society given they only appear in the last act of the last film in the trilogy you get to know their customs their temperament their sense of community and honor they aren’t just a pair of cute eyes and soft fur they are violent they are crafty they can kill you and eat you other nonstop complaint about the ewoks is the beyond tired “omg i can’t believe a group of savage teddy bears can beat the empire so stupid” ewoks didn’t beat “the empire” the ewoks had help from the rebellion in taking out a platoon or regiment or whatever you want to call it so the rebels could complete their mission so this ever so stale narrative that the “ewoks beat the empire” is flat out false in fact if you actually pay attention the ewoks get their furry little rumps handed to them by the empire for the first half of the battle it’s not until chewie and wicket steal an atst and start blasting away that the tide of the battle turns for the ewoks we all want to see the version of the film where it was wookies instead of ewoks you can choose to say lucas is lying when he said casting and creating all of the wookies was too much of a logistical hassle or you can choose to believe him it doesn’t really matter we have the ewoks and they serve the same purpose the wookies would have just in a smaller package could go into the throne room stuff with luke vader and the emperor but i don’t think i need to it’s the most praised aspect of the film what i will say is that luke in rotj is still my favorite depiction of a jedi in the films love his cool and collected exterior i love his sense of compassion i love his flirtations with the dark side that are never explicit until he loses it on vader for threatening leia i love how he grew beyond the teaching of yoda and obi wan to become his own jedi with his own sense of what becoming one means to him i’m a goddamn sucker for green lightsabers i love green lightsabers summary return of the jedi is every bit the star wars film its predecessors are but due to circumstances beyond its existence i feel that it has been the target of unfairly jaded takes over the years which brings me to my next argument early beginnings of the fandom menace seems that online at least literally everyone has an opinion about star wars and everyone is going to make sure that their opinion is seen and validated by as many people as possible i’m no different i did just spent a few hours typing up over 2000 words probably only a few people will read if im lucky with my mediocre ramblings wars by virtue of its own massive success became something other than a series of wellliked films people treat them like gospel like a bible there are movies and then there is star wars due to that love being so allconsuming the ownership a fan feels over it makes them feel superior makes them feel like they have it all figured out and everyone else is wrong when a movie or show or book or whatever comes that they don’t like they take it as a personal attack they see it as an affront to their taste their understanding and their brand loyalty could lucasdisney do this to me” why you see endless yt videos with pseudointellectual talking points explaining how fundamentally broken the st is that’s why the pt was a laughing stock for over a decade until the haters moved on to the st that’s why people feel they have the right to insult you and challenge your intelligence over liking or disliking a damn movie is how i feel about star wars and because i am a real fan i get to dictate my objective opinion onto others and surround myself with likeminded people who only serve to inflate my false sense of critical superiority” didn’t mean for this to get so heavy but i feel that this particular contingent of fans who dislike rotj were kind of the beginning of the fandom menace or more accurately   the beginning of the attitude tfm exudes suddenly the conversation wasn’t “i like all three but jedi is the weakest” or “i love all three equally” the conversation turned more bitter angry and aggressive when the special editions came out way see it which i acknowledge is purely my own subjective perception  rotj went from being accepted wholeheartedly as the final film in the trilogy to the root of all evil that the sw franchise would become the criticism of rotj may seem mild compared to the volume of hate the pt had and the st is havingand it is but the hate that is there is just as strong as it is with the pt and ot its not uncommon to see purists lamenting that star wars should have ended in 1980 or that there hasnt been a truly good star wars film since 1980 just so nobody gets the wrong idea im not saying people who dislike or criticize rotj are fandom menace im not saying people need to like the film or are wrong for disliking it or seeing it as the weakest of the ot its totally fine to feel however you feel about it merely hypothesizing that some of the attitudes present in tfm go back to the shift in perspective some fans had for rotj in the 90s if somebody thought rotj was the weakest then that was that its wasnt anything deeper they still loved it it was still star wars and it was embraced just like anh and esb lucas was nerd jesus for decades then the cracks began to show when fans were displeased with the special editions and lucas’s refusal to properly release the original versions the lucas hate only intensified when the pt was coming out he went from messiah to devil in the span of a decade dont think i can stress enough for younger fans just how intense the hatred for lucas was for a very very long time while it wasnt as widespread as online hatred is now due to conversations being relegated to forums and chats the hatred was indeed omnipresent in the fandom people felt personally viscerally betrayed by lucas for the changes he made to the ot and for the prequels ironically the people who called for his head are praying for his return passion fans have for this universe is as much a curse as it is something special i don’t care how much you worship these movies i don’t care how much you separate star wars from all other film as that special something at the end of the day they are still just movies i feel confident saying this because i also feel that special way about star wars it is special it is it’s own thing to me but i can still separate my devotion to it and see the reality of it they’re just movies guys they’re just freaking movies,0,13709,2535,0,0.148,0.691,0.161,0.991

I didn't hate it but I didn't love it and I wasn't sure that I liked how Luke was portrayed. And while there are still a few things about the film that I don't care for, Luke's story is by far my favorite part of not only TLJ, but the entire Sequel Trilogy.

●

It seems to me that many fans take issue with Luke for superficial reasons. ""He never even left the island, he wouldn't say this, he wouldn't do that"" etc. And there are legitimate criticisms to be had, but I think there is a bigger picture that these people are missing. For example, everybody wants to talk about how he could NEVER be even tempted to consider killing his nephew. Yet, we know Luke has a tendency to act on emotion. In TESB he sees a vision of his friends in pain and suffering and rashly abandons his training, against Yoda and Obi-Wan's wishes, to try and save them. The consequences of which leave him without a hand and with a burden that, according to Yoda, he wasn't ready to bear. In RotJ, Luke goes into a fit of rage at the mention of Vader turning Leia to the Dark Side, beating him down and stopping just short of killing him. Of course when he realizes how close he is to turning to the Dark Side and that he could become just like his Father, he comes to his senses and declares himself a Jedi.

In TLJ, we see in the flashback scene that Luke had sensed darkness in Ben but he discovers that it was beyond what he ever imagined. Just like in TESB, he sees visions of the future. ""He who would bring destruction and pain and death and the end of everything I loved because of what he would become.."" He could see that his heart was already turned. In all of these instances the context that informs his actions is the desire to protect the ones he loves. Personally, both Mark Hamill's excellent performance and the dialogue are more than enough to convince me. I could absolutely believe that Luke would fearfully grab for his saber in that moment before coming to his senses. And it's clear that if Ben hadn't seen him, we all know he would have left and began putting all of his effort into trying to help him and save him from Snoke. 

But that's not the story and that's not the point. The point is, no matter how skilled or wise Luke may be, he's still capable of making mistakes. Nobody is immune to failure, least of all the Jedi. Luke's arc in TLJ was about humanizing him and not playing into the massive expectations the audience (and the characters) had for him.

●

Another thing people want to say is that Luke was ""wrong"" in the Last Jedi. He even says it himself in TROS, though he's specifically referring to his exile, not his ideology. But Luke is pretty much correct in most of what he teaches Rey in the TLJ. The Force is bigger than the Jedi. They don't own the ""light"" or the capacity to use the Force for good. And unfortunately the legacy of the Jedi was failure in his eyes. They DID allow the Emperor to rise to power, create the Empire and wipe them out. Then Luke himself failed to rebuild a new Jedi Order. His disillusionment should at least be understandable. And the thing is, he is still doing what he thinks is right. He believes that the Jedi are fundamentally flawed and perpetuating this cycle and that by removing himself from the galaxy and letting the Jedi die with him, he's making way for something better that can rise up against the Dark Side.

That might sound like sacrilege, but any issues that people have with this story SHOULD be mitigated by the fact that Luke does, in fact, come full circle back from ""It's time for the Jedi to end."" to ""I will not be The Last Jedi."" Does this just get overlooked? People want to act like Luke just lived and died a miserable failure and it's simple-minded nonsense. By the end, he embraces the ""Legend"" that he had resented and in a way, does the very thing he had mocked in the beginning of the film, taking on the whole First Order with a laser sword.

●

That's actually one of my favorite specific elements of his story. The first time I saw it, I disliked that it wasn't his RotJ saber because I wanted that visual continuity from the OT. And there's nothing wrong with wanting that, but you have to look at the broader thematic elements, represented by that lightsaber, for Luke's characterization in the film. It represents his unwillingness and later acceptance of being what Rey (and us) expects and needs him to be. He refused it from Rey not once, but twice, at two significant moments in the story, but after a knock on the head and one last lesson from Yoda, he realizes that the galaxy does need him. That the Jedi don't have to end to make way for something better, they can be better. 

In other words, when he chooses to appear with that lightsaber it's symbolic and represents that he is finally accepting it from Rey. THIS is the payoff, both for the end of TFA and for having tossed it away earlier, and it should be all the more gratifying to the viewers for it. I think Johnson wanted the fans to feel strongly about that moment, so that seeing him with it at the end would he that much more impactful. In that moment when he stands against Ben Solo, who is essentially the physical representation of his failure to uphold his legacy, he is reclaiming that legacy sparking a new hope in the galaxy.

●

As much as I dislike it, Luke was never meant to be a main character in the story of the Sequel Trilogy. Neither were Han and Leia. They existed in these films as nostalgic anchors to prop up the new characters. Each film was meant to give one of the three ""Legacy"" characters their moment in the sun, their swan song. Again, I am not a fan of this structure but acknowledging it should give us an understanding as to why Luke's death at the end of TLJ was inevitable. 

And if the intention was for Luke to die, I'm glad that it wasn't just like Han's death and that Johnson found a way for him to have that epic return without having to get cut down or blasted into oblivion on the battlefield. Instead, he's able to reunite with Leia and single handedly save the last of the Resistance using a new Force ability. THEN he peacefully becomes one with the Force under the light of a binary sunset. If that's not poetry and rhyming I don't know what is. It's like his journey ends the same way it began.

1975,Who I think Snoke was and his intentions.,27,iig4xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/iig4xp/who_i_think_snoke_was_and_his_intentions/,3,1598679483.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/di47pxtobtj51.jpg?width=2292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cb6cd8c786bbcd3190f59fc24b3a7702bedc72e

This is who I think Snoke was based on what I’ve read and seen. He was a person who had witnessed the rise and fall of the empire from his home world of Exegol. He’s Palpatine’s “Frankenstein” in the sense that he was made using cloning and Sith alchemy. The multiple copies of his body hint towards the possibility that his “essence”, like Palpatine’s, was possibly transferred between clone bodies. He could have been an early “test subject” in regards to the “essence transfer” and cloning Palpatine and the Sith Eternal were trying to master.

In regards to the story - Palpatine and the Sith Eternal gave him the reigns to the military machine that is the First Order with three main objectives: 1. to seduce Ben Solo to the dark side so that Palpatine would have the perfect vessel to transfer into; 2. to destroy Luke Skywalker, the last hope of the Jedi and 3. To instill fear in the Galaxy with the First Order as a first ""push"" before the final order began.

However as we all know, dark siders/Sith have a knack of disobeying their masters and seek power for themselves and that's what I think Snoke was doing.

He was a neo-Sith in charge of a neo-Empire who was clearly influenced by the Empire of old – with his red-clad Praetorian Guards and obsession with Vader (he does wear a ring encrusted with obsidian obtained from beneath Fortress Vader on Mustafar).

Snoke was possibly even trained by Palpatine and saw an opportunity to seize power for himself which is why he wanted Rey dead in TLJ - he probably knew she was a Palpatine and didn't want Palpatine regaining power. He knew about the dyad/bond in Ben and Rey and was hoping he could continue his rule as Supreme Leader with Ben Solo as his rabid dog apprentice – reminiscent of the glory days of the Empire with Palpatine who had Vader on a leash.

Of course, his plan didn’t work out, but he got very close. Snoke probably despised Palpatine and was jealous of the former Sith Lord. We’ve seen other Sith apprentices try to recruit and seize power for themselves (like Dooku), so this is very possible. He took what teachings/information Palpatine gave him before departing Exegol and used it to his advantage.

On the other side of the coin - Palpatine didn’t trust Snoke either which is proven by his manipulation of Snoke's voice in Ben's mind, making Ben hate Snoke that much more. For example: one day Snoke is training Ben and then that night when Ben is alone, Palpatine pretends to be Snoke in Ben's mind and berates the boy even further - because remember - Palpatine wants Ben to kill Snoke, proving that he can be a worthy heir to the Sith. That’s one of the main differences with Palpatine in the ST as compared to the OT, is that he’s in the shadows even more so and is willing to let the apprentice kill the master which he had seen play out in his previous life when Vader killed him.

To sum it up: Snoke was used as a ""stand-in emperor"" by Palpatine to get the Galaxy ready for his eventual return. Snoke was definitely his own person as we can see he has a different personality than Palpatine in TLJ – Palpatine is calm and confident where as Snoke can have angry outbursts. Snoke is one of my favorite characters to come out of the ST because of the mystery that surrounds him and Andy Serkis' amazing performance.",StarWarsCantina,"who i think snoke was and his intentions 

 is who i think snoke was based on what i’ve read and seen he was a person who had witnessed the rise and fall of the empire from his home world of exegol he’s palpatine’s “frankenstein” in the sense that he was made using cloning and sith alchemy the multiple copies of his body hint towards the possibility that his “essence” like palpatine’s was possibly transferred between clone bodies he could have been an early “test subject” in regards to the “essence transfer” and cloning palpatine and the sith eternal were trying to master regards to the story  palpatine and the sith eternal gave him the reigns to the military machine that is the first order with three main objectives 1 to seduce ben solo to the dark side so that palpatine would have the perfect vessel to transfer into 2 to destroy luke skywalker the last hope of the jedi and 3 to instill fear in the galaxy with the first order as a first push before the final order began as we all know dark siderssith have a knack of disobeying their masters and seek power for themselves and thats what i think snoke was doing was a neosith in charge of a neoempire who was clearly influenced by the empire of old – with his redclad praetorian guards and obsession with vader he does wear a ring encrusted with obsidian obtained from beneath fortress vader on mustafar was possibly even trained by palpatine and saw an opportunity to seize power for himself which is why he wanted rey dead in tlj  he probably knew she was a palpatine and didnt want palpatine regaining power he knew about the dyadbond in ben and rey and was hoping he could continue his rule as supreme leader with ben solo as his rabid dog apprentice – reminiscent of the glory days of the empire with palpatine who had vader on a leash course his plan didn’t work out but he got very close snoke probably despised palpatine and was jealous of the former sith lord we’ve seen other sith apprentices try to recruit and seize power for themselves like dooku so this is very possible he took what teachingsinformation palpatine gave him before departing exegol and used it to his advantage the other side of the coin  palpatine didn’t trust snoke either which is proven by his manipulation of snokes voice in bens mind making ben hate snoke that much more for example one day snoke is training ben and then that night when ben is alone palpatine pretends to be snoke in bens mind and berates the boy even further  because remember  palpatine wants ben to kill snoke proving that he can be a worthy heir to the sith that’s one of the main differences with palpatine in the st as compared to the ot is that he’s in the shadows even more so and is willing to let the apprentice kill the master which he had seen play out in his previous life when vader killed him sum it up snoke was used as a standin emperor by palpatine to get the galaxy ready for his eventual return snoke was definitely his own person as we can see he has a different personality than palpatine in tlj – palpatine is calm and confident where as snoke can have angry outbursts snoke is one of my favorite characters to come out of the st because of the mystery that surrounds him and andy serkis amazing performance",0,3481,610,0,0.08,0.839,0.081,-0.5734

I went from absolutely hating it to accepting it to loving it. At the time the hype for this movie was incredibly high, tv ads were playing non-stop, people were renting out theaters to see it by themselves, and critics and fans  were foaming at the mouth for it. I remember after watching it and thinking that's it? The hype did definitely get to me but let me get to why I hated it at the time, I didn't like any of the new characters except for maybe Finn and BB-8, I thought Rey was a Mary Sue ( yup I was one of those), I thought Kylo was overbearing and whiny at the time I was a die-hard prequel fan ( still a fan but I recognize more of the flaws) and I thought he was just  a worse version of Anakin I hated that there was another Death Star although to be fair I still don't like Starkiller base, I hated Han's death and pretty much the entire plot. My mind has changed a lot on the sequels after TLJ and TROS I love them now and Kylo Ren is now my favorite fictional character of all time. So know you now what I used to think about this movie and so I'll talk about my current thoughts. First of all Kylo Ren's entrance is so cool and absolutely cements him as the villain of this series, I love Kylo Ren in this, he's just a straight up monster and I'm here for it. Finn and Poe might have the best friendship in the sequel trilogy they have instant chemistry and man I wish they got together. Rey's introduction and theme makes me smile now her theme just perfectly encapsulates her character and seeing her daily routine and how lonely her life is makes you like her instantly and Daisy Ridley does such a great job selling you of her character without any dialogue she's great. I also just love her relationship with Finn it never feels romantic to me more like siblings and I love Rey kicking Finn's ass instantly within meeting him, Rey is so badass and I loved seeing her handle herself. I also love Han Solo in this and his relationship with both Finn and Rey. I also really love his death now. This whole movie is just a blast from start to finish and the pacing is perfect. Now let's get into some complaints, I think the whole gang scene after we're introduced to Han is pretty boring and it felt they just added it in because they needed an action scene, I really hate Starkiller base I understand why they added it in but I do wish they had done something a little more creative rather then do another Death Star, I wish Rey didn't mind trick that Stormtrooper I think it would have been better if she had used her street smarts to escape and then officially uses the force for the first time when pulling the lightsaber to her it would've been a much cooler reveal, I also wish rather then winning the fight between her and Kylo I wish it were a draw. I don't mind her winning but I think it would have been cooler if it ended in a draw with the planet being split apart and them staring at each other, it would've left the audience wondering who would've won, I also wish Leia had hugged Chewie instead of Rey, it makes way more sense for Rey to go with Finn rather than Chewie although my sister pointed out that maybe Chewie went with Finn because Finn had patched him up which was a cute way to think about. Overall this is a really fun but familiar entry that I've come to love in the Star Wars saga.

It's not the only theory that could have worked but it works. One thing that would have been funny as hell is if Rey turned out to be the reincarnation of Anakin. That would have made for a hilarious reveal in Episode VIII. There could have been a scene where Luke reaches out through the Force and comes across the startling truth - she is his father!!! In TESB, someone told Luke ""I am your father."" and this time, he would be telling someone ""You are my father!?"".

When JJ came back, I was again 100% convinced that he would reveal that Rey is Luke's daughter.

Just wanted to splurge my ideas on a major Sequel battle in my headcanon as I’ve attempted to flesh it out. This will be presented as some kind of overview looking back at the battle, not a retelling of it.

Utupau was the farthest the New Republic formally extended towards Hutt space, and was thus, home to the 9th NR fleet, assigned to primarily anti-pirating operations, based on the flagship *Shakalia* Admiral Nimizia oversaw the fleet, comprised of two MC-95s, an MC-85, and 31 various smaller vessels including the *Exemplarance* veteran of the Galactic Civil war. despite its outdated nature, 9th fleet was still one of the largest battle groups possessed by the New Republic. 

Utupau had grown into a fairly industrious planet and sported small shipyards producing various freighters and support craft for the New Republic, as well as housing a significant research center. It was these capabilities that made it a prime target for a First Order invasion.

The First Order 15th battlegroup, based around the battlecruiser *Constrictor* was tasked with assaulting and eliminating the New Republic at Utupau. The Battlegroup comprised of 4 resurgent class battlecruisers, 4 diligent class corvettes, 6 light cruisers, and the Nebulon K frigate *Starboard’s wrath*. The light cruisers had been pulled from the 5th bombardment group, which had been split to reinforce the attack at Naboo.

Approximately 15 galactic minutes after the Hosnian cataclysm, and right in the middle of a frenzied intelligence briefing, the First Order ships entered the Utupau system, just outside of effective firing range, and launched what could only be described as a hailstorm of fighters. Admiral Nimizia immediately ordered the engagement of crystal wing, comprising the bulk of 9th fleet’s fighter escort. Jade, Diamond, Ruby, Amethyst, Saphire, and Emerald squadron moved into defensive position as approximately 400 First Order fighters approached. 

As the 16th battlegroup moves into firing range, they quickly picked off 5 smaller  New Republic ships and freighters, as they attempted to scurry under the protection of the Mon Calamari shield arrays. As the New Republic battle line tightened around he orbital stations and shipyards of Utupau, the First order deployed all their light cruisers and transports, under the escort of the *Starboard’s wrath* to attempt and make a run on the planet itself.

As both navies clashed in The initial engagement, New Republic fighters found themselves quickly outmatched and forced to fall back to the cover of the escort ships, Saphire and Diamond squadron failed to return and were obliterated. First Order fighter and bomber forces suffered a similar fate however, when attempting to make a run on the *Sawremption* the only other MC-95 in the fleet.

As both sides fell back to kick their wounds, Nimizia realized The First Order had almost reached the surface. In a desperate bid, she deployed all New Republic ground forces to the planet, and to cover for them, ordered Jade and Emerald squadron, to conduct a suicide run on the *Starboard’s wrath* in order to allow the troops to reach the surface. Outnumbered 3 to 1, Jade and Emerald squadron plunged into the landing group and scored hit after hit on the First Order ship, each time having their numbers shaved off. As the *Starboard’s wrath* entered firing range of the transports, Jade 9 led a last ditch attack on the cruiser and scored a lucky hit on the engine reactors that made the ship dead in the water, as Jade and Emerald squadron broke off the attack, They watched the fireworks and somberly reflected on their near 50% causality rate.

Thanks to their heroic efforts however, the First Order landing force was unable to advance, and had to instead, dig in and prepare for an elongated siege. For another 2 days, both sides occasionally engaged, firing salvoes and blaster bolts, cannons and missiles, only to pull back once again, bit by bit, the First Order was chipping away at the 9th fleet, but they themselves were running low on fighter reserves and escort ships. 

Displeased with the lack of progress in the battle, from his station on the Finalizer, Hux ordered the reallocation of the 5th Bombardment group to Utupau, he would not have the Republic defy him. As the 4th day of battle raged on, in the sky, and on the ground, the 9th fleet was getting antsy, Nimizia had relocated Jade and Emerald to a station aboard the *Pragmattus* , behind the battle lines, the 9th was down to sub 100 fighters and 19 supplementary ships, even still, Nimizia had hope, that reinforcements would arrive, and perhaps even the Resistance would arrive to assist. It was not to be. 

Arriving in system, the *Municiator* and her escorts immediately targeted the *Sawremption* and in the fraction of a second, the tide of battle had turned. The Mandator’s cannons ripped through the massive mon cal ship and tore it assunder, leaving a gaping hole in the 9th fleet’s battleline.

Immediately reacting, Nimizia desperately ordered the *Pragmattus* and surrounding ships to evacuate and carry as many Utupauns as they could, Jade and Emerald squadron made desperate,fast trips to the planet surface to evacuate as many people as they could, smaller ships and freighters being torn apart around them. The First Order moved in for the kill while the Mandator stayed far behind, safe from any last ditch attacks.

As the fleet carried out her Orders, Nimizia moved to the main bridge of the *Shakalia* and piloted The massive warship to put The fleeing *Pragmattus* in her shadow, and took the full brunt of 4 Resurgent broadsides to ensure as much time as possible to the evacuation. As More and More First Order Forces made it to the ground. And more and more of her ships went down around her, Nimizia ordered the Pragmattus to leave, and as the last of Jade squadron docked with the MC-85 and disappeared into hyperspace, Nimizia watched with the same sense of hope she’d always carried, and sighed in resignation, as the *Shakalia* burst into flames, hit by round after round from the *Municiator*.

Utupau would fall a day later, it’s cities and facilities burning craters, and it’s people, save for those evacuated aboard what remained of the 9th, wiped from the face of the Galaxy.

We know that >!Thrawn was whisked away by the space whales in rebels!< which could explain why the New Republic never faced him for so long. 

It allows the story we got in rebels to have a more conclusive ending rather than leaving us questioning it and speculating. His storyline also falls in place with current cannon (9 years ABY and 5 years after RoTJ and the sequels taking place much farther after) 

The only discrepancy would be the twins and C’baoth, but that in my head is patched with it simply being Ben and going with that. Helped plant the seeds of doubt in Luke’s mind. Making him less if the pure Jedi we see in RoTJ and more of the fearful and overly cautious one we saw in the flashbacks during TLJ.
