24,"don’t know if this is allowed here so please take it down if it’s not the battle of utupau 34 aby wanted to splurge my ideas on a major sequel battle in my headcanon as i’ve attempted to flesh it out this will be presented as some kind of overview looking back at the battle not a retelling of it was the farthest the new republic formally extended towards hutt space and was thus home to the 9th nr fleet assigned to primarily antipirating operations based on the flagship shakalia admiral nimizia oversaw the fleet comprised of two mc95s an mc85 and 31 various smaller vessels including the exemplarance veteran of the galactic civil war despite its outdated nature 9th fleet was still one of the largest battle groups possessed by the new republic  had grown into a fairly industrious planet and sported small shipyards producing various freighters and support craft for the new republic as well as housing a significant research center it was these capabilities that made it a prime target for a first order invasion first order 15th battlegroup based around the battlecruiser constrictor was tasked with assaulting and eliminating the new republic at utupau the battlegroup comprised of 4 resurgent class battlecruisers 4 diligent class corvettes 6 light cruisers and the nebulon k frigate starboard’s wrath the light cruisers had been pulled from the 5th bombardment group which had been split to reinforce the attack at naboo 15 galactic minutes after the hosnian cataclysm and right in the middle of a frenzied intelligence briefing the first order ships entered the utupau system just outside of effective firing range and launched what could only be described as a hailstorm of fighters admiral nimizia immediately ordered the engagement of crystal wing comprising the bulk of 9th fleet’s fighter escort jade diamond ruby amethyst saphire and emerald squadron moved into defensive position as approximately 400 first order fighters approached  the 16th battlegroup moves into firing range they quickly picked off 5 smaller  new republic ships and freighters as they attempted to scurry under the protection of the mon calamari shield arrays as the new republic battle line tightened around he orbital stations and shipyards of utupau the first order deployed all their light cruisers and transports under the escort of the starboard’s wrath to attempt and make a run on the planet itself both navies clashed in the initial engagement new republic fighters found themselves quickly outmatched and forced to fall back to the cover of the escort ships saphire and diamond squadron failed to return and were obliterated first order fighter and bomber forces suffered a similar fate however when attempting to make a run on the sawremption the only other mc95 in the fleet both sides fell back to kick their wounds nimizia realized the first order had almost reached the surface in a desperate bid she deployed all new republic ground forces to the planet and to cover for them ordered jade and emerald squadron to conduct a suicide run on the starboard’s wrath in order to allow the troops to reach the surface outnumbered 3 to 1 jade and emerald squadron plunged into the landing group and scored hit after hit on the first order ship each time having their numbers shaved off as the starboard’s wrath entered firing range of the transports jade 9 led a last ditch attack on the cruiser and scored a lucky hit on the engine reactors that made the ship dead in the water as jade and emerald squadron broke off the attack they watched the fireworks and somberly reflected on their near 50 causality rate to their heroic efforts however the first order landing force was unable to advance and had to instead dig in and prepare for an elongated siege for another 2 days both sides occasionally engaged firing salvoes and blaster bolts cannons and missiles only to pull back once again bit by bit the first order was chipping away at the 9th fleet but they themselves were running low on fighter reserves and escort ships  with the lack of progress in the battle from his station on the finalizer hux ordered the reallocation of the 5th bombardment group to utupau he would not have the republic defy him as the 4th day of battle raged on in the sky and on the ground the 9th fleet was getting antsy nimizia had relocated jade and emerald to a station aboard the pragmattus  behind the battle lines the 9th was down to sub 100 fighters and 19 supplementary ships even still nimizia had hope that reinforcements would arrive and perhaps even the resistance would arrive to assist it was not to be  in system the municiator and her escorts immediately targeted the sawremption and in the fraction of a second the tide of battle had turned the mandator’s cannons ripped through the massive mon cal ship and tore it assunder leaving a gaping hole in the 9th fleet’s battleline reacting nimizia desperately ordered the pragmattus and surrounding ships to evacuate and carry as many utupauns as they could jade and emerald squadron made desperatefast trips to the planet surface to evacuate as many people as they could smaller ships and freighters being torn apart around them the first order moved in for the kill while the mandator stayed far behind safe from any last ditch attacks the fleet carried out her orders nimizia moved to the main bridge of the shakalia and piloted the massive warship to put the fleeing pragmattus in her shadow and took the full brunt of 4 resurgent broadsides to ensure as much time as possible to the evacuation as more and more first order forces made it to the ground and more and more of her ships went down around her nimizia ordered the pragmattus to leave and as the last of jade squadron docked with the mc85 and disappeared into hyperspace nimizia watched with the same sense of hope she’d always carried and sighed in resignation as the shakalia burst into flames hit by round after round from the municiator would fall a day later it’s cities and facilities burning craters and it’s people save for those evacuated aboard what remained of the 9th wiped from the face of the galaxy

96,cantina patrons i humbly present to you the star wars a 195 hr continuous cut of the skywalker saga using the st as the framing device and showing the rest of the story through a series of flashbacks after about 30 hours of rendering my creation is alive kind of inspired by the format of the first 150 pages thats all ive gotten through so far of sometimes a great notion by ken kesey every shot from the saga is included and i tried to be conservative with my editing also john williams makes it really tough to get too crazy with the editing hes all over the place major changes include seeing the events of the second half of rots after obiwan has his final conversation with anakin and leaves for utapau first from obiwanyodabails perspective and then later through anakins perspective the last jedi is edited so that reys time on ahchto happens earlier in relation to the story of the dqar evacuation and flows directly out of the end of tfa the podrace and all of quigons experiences on tatooine now happen in the dark recesses of c3pos mind in the nanosecond that his memory gets erased in ros relative dates are included in the alien dialogue subtitle file eg 34 years earlier 10 years later etc the first time we transition to a new time period oh yeah and i used the 2004 special editions for the ot because jedi rocks rocks fight me below is the full plot outline

and darth maul chasing them the rest of episode 1 plays out as usual but obiwan doesnt bother to remember the parade on naboo instead we fade from quigons funeral to 10 years later as padme and her entourage approach courascant in their ships at the start of episode 2 gets assigned obiwan and anakin as her bouncers and as they ride the elevator up to her apartment obiwan tells anakin that he needs to chill out and relax and anakin says i havent seen her in ten years master as both recall the parade on naboo ten years prior fade to episode 1 parade scene lil ani smiles at padme padme

107,something the sequels did better than the other trilogies in my opinion i know there’s so much anger towards the sequels and i’m a little bit with you but we must admit the color schemes and lighting were absolutely phenomenal weren’t just beautiful they enhanced the story tfa was a constant dual between blue and red a classic star wars trope they were saying “we’re back it’s star wars again” then tlj was red like almost the whole time it was showing how sometimes the story gets darker than you think it was also about confronting the darkness within and then ros was blue for most the time showing that good prevails  a plus for the sequels if you’re going to comment how “this is irrelevant” or “pointless post” or something like that you might as well not even bother,821,143,0.8541,0.099,0.745,0.155,0,1

115,"reassessing the sequels i’ve been active on this sub for a while now and in that time i have set it upon myself forcefully dissuade sequel fans from being sequel fans i have had several heated arguments about how luke was ruined and how rey is a mary sue  however in rewatching the sequels i have been reminded of a quote which i have always held firm to rather hypocritically as of late
 cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence i much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers i think that many confuse applicability with allegory but the one resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author”  j r r tolkien afterward of the fellowship of the ring pride myself on being an as of yet amateur writer with a decent level of skill and i have always praised tolkien for his philosophical works on writing and fantasy  namely tolkien believed in a loosely built world where interpretations are subject to the reader rather than the author  in rewatching the sequels i have found many areas where one can apply this freedom of interpretation and see the hidden beauty of the films  for instance rey touches anakin’s lightsaber and in the process of her vision she hears ewan mcgregor’s obiwan say “these are your first steps”  later in the film we see her display the first force power ever displayed in star wars as rey bends the mind of james bond a stormtrooper  taken separately this looks like lazy writing but taken together in the context of a fluid narrative i believe now that rey learned that power from obiwan himself previously biggest qualm with the sequels has always been the presentation of luke  while i still think the old master was mishandled kylo should have turned despite luke’s persistent help not due to luke’s actions out of fear i do see the respect which johnson has for the character   have nothing to say about the canto bite sequence it still sucks  if you like it great but otherwise i still hate it thing which the sequels do phenomenally is the display of the force  i’m glad that the creators took advantage of the technology because seeing jedi fly around and control blaster bolts was just a treat  each trilogy has its strength the ot has the best story the pt has the best choreographed lightsaber fights and the force definitely belongs to the st back at my old assumption about the trilogy i see that i let the same sort of snobbishness come over me which pervades the amateur and often the professional viewing audience  with the internet everyone can become a critic and that provides for the more spoiled viewers who like everything explained up front to put their word in  rewatching the prequels has really taught me something there’s always more than meets the eye and i shouldn’t expect to be spoonfed character details  maybe it’s a lesson we all could learn to let our imagination run wild know that this is a star wars sub but since i started with a quote form tolkien i wanted to end with one because i think it’s pertinent to the discussion
 of course starts out with an advantage arresting strangeness but that advantage has been turned against it and has contributed to its disrepute many people dislike being “arrested” they dislike any meddling with the primary world or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them they therefore stupidly and even maliciously confound fantasy with dreaming in which there is no art and with mental disorders in which there is not even control with delusion and hallucination”  j r r tolkien on fairy stories",3839,663,0.9902,0.07200000000000001,0.8109999999999999,0.11699999999999999,0,1

219,my journey and updated review of tlj  is a movie i saw purely out of curiosity at the time i wasnt really interested in the sequel trilogy as the force awakens really disappointed me so i had no plans to see it after the insane backlash i was quite curious why this movie was receiving so much hate since i was really sick at the time i couldnt go see it so i watched spoiler videos instead and i still couldnt understand the immense hate after i started to feel better i went to see it in theaters and was surprised by how much i liked it there were so many things that genuinely shocked me even though i had seen spoiler videos it couldnt compare to actually seeing it after the last jedi i started to really get into star wars and kylo ren became my favorite fictional character this movie really sparked my love for star wars anyway now that you know my backstory with this movie let me get into my actual review i think the opening with poe while fun is probably the weakest opening in the sequel trilogy the transition to finn asking where rey is to it cutting to achtoo is pretty great but im not sure why they needed to recreate the moment she walks up the steps it couldve just cut to her waiting for lukes answer with her hand outstretched luke chucking the lightsaber is amazing and never fails to get a laugh out of me grumpy luke is my favorite again the transition when luke says wheres han and it cuts to kylo is masterful speaking of i love every single thing having to do with kylo rian took a really evil guy in tfa and made us care for him and of course adam driver nails it reys and kylos relationship is so interesting everytime they force connect are some of the best parts of the movie as is her relationship with luke now lets get to the controversial stuff which is rose and canto bight personally while i dont really mind rose i dont really like her either definitely one my least favorite sw characters canto bight is all right but it goes on way too long and feels really goofy it doesnt match the tone with the rest of the movie at all also i feel like finn doesnt really have anything to do it feels like hes kind of along with the ride it should have been him to break them out of prison speaking of i dont know why people complain so much about rose when dj is there i legitimately cant stand him and i have no idea why he has a weird and frankly offensive stutter it makes no sense that they would find another master code breaker in the same prison theyre in justin theroux shouldve remained the code breaker dj was totally unnecessary  another controversial aspect is holdo and her subplot with poe which i actually love holdos a badass and it makes complete sense for her to not tell poe the plan since hes so unpredictable arguably the best part of the movie is the throne room scene my jaw dropped when kylo killed snoke the way it was done was so cool and seeing it for the first time is an experience ill never get again it was just so cool same thing with holdo going into lightspeed the cinematography in that scene is chefs kiss and my whole audience gasped everything on crait is really great although i hate rose ramming into finn and that awful kiss they have zero chemistry and it feels so out of place luke showing up is amazing and his whole interaction with kylo is awesome his death even now moves me i honestly think he got the best death in star wars it was exactly how i wanted him to go peacefully and with purpose as rey puts it sorry this review is so long this is my favorite star wars movie and while it has a lot of flaws i still really love it and rewatch it often,3690,698,0.9821,0.14300000000000002,0.696,0.161,0,1

jaro kan’s father had worked in the archives of the jedi temple before the days of the empire during his time there he came across a series of incomplete prophecies prophecies that had been handed down from one  generation to the next but had never been fulfilled or looked into further jaro’s father would recite these to him as he would fall asleep at night tales of a dragon tamer who lived in the sand or tales of two forcesensitive individuals mysteriously connected through space and  time as he listened he found himself wondering why these no one had looked into these further could it have been possible that the prophecies themselves actually had been fulfilled yet somehow no one knew about them if the prophecies were true it would change the course of the of a great many things in the galaxy   
years after the empire overtook the jedi order and the republic jaro found himself hiding on the planet batuu anyone known to have an association with the jedi even to those who were merely archive workers were often taken in for intense questioning from the empire never to be heard from again jaro’s parents were unfortunately apart of these roundups  to this day he still never quite knew if his parents were dead or alive  he preferred to think the latter of those options in hopes that they were not suffering at the hands of the empire   
jaro embarks on a quest to find one of the prophecies written down by his father he ends up on coruscant where he comes across a book of  “forgotten prophecies” during his quest he discovers that not only are his parents alive but are being used by emperor palpatine to locate the whereabouts of these sought after tales along with rumors of another alleged searcher trying to hunt them down as well",1937,340,0.4931,0.073,0.847,0.079,0,1

292,"my journey with force awakens and updated review since i saw it recently tfa is a movie i have a strange relationship with i went from absolutely hating it to accepting it to loving it at the time the hype for this movie was incredibly high tv ads were playing nonstop people were renting out theaters to see it by themselves and critics and fans  were foaming at the mouth for it i remember after watching it and thinking thats it the hype did definitely get to me but let me get to why i hated it at the time i didnt like any of the new characters except for maybe finn and bb8 i thought rey was a mary sue  yup i was one of those i thought kylo was overbearing and whiny at the time i was a diehard prequel fan  still a fan but i recognize more of the flaws and i thought he was just  a worse version of anakin i hated that there was another death star although to be fair i still dont like starkiller base i hated hans death and pretty much the entire plot my mind has changed a lot on the sequels after tlj and tros i love them now and kylo ren is now my favorite fictional character of all time so know you now what i used to think about this movie and so ill talk about my current thoughts first of all kylo rens entrance is so cool and absolutely cements him as the villain of this series i love kylo ren in this hes just a straight up monster and im here for it finn and poe might have the best friendship in the sequel trilogy they have instant chemistry and man i wish they got together reys introduction and theme makes me smile now her theme just perfectly encapsulates her character and seeing her daily routine and how lonely her life is makes you like her instantly and daisy ridley does such a great job selling you of her character without any dialogue shes great i also just love her relationship with finn it never feels romantic to me more like siblings and i love rey kicking finns ass instantly within meeting him rey is so badass and i loved seeing her handle herself i also love han solo in this and his relationship with both finn and rey i also really love his death now this whole movie is just a blast from start to finish and the pacing is perfect now lets get into some complaints i think the whole gang scene after were introduced to han is pretty boring and it felt they just added it in because they needed an action scene i really hate starkiller base i understand why they added it in but i do wish they had done something a little more creative rather then do another death star i wish rey didnt mind trick that stormtrooper i think it would have been better if she had used her street smarts to escape and then officially uses the force for the first time when pulling the lightsaber to her it wouldve been a much cooler reveal i also wish rather then winning the fight between her and kylo i wish it were a draw i dont mind her winning but i think it would have been cooler if it ended in a draw with the planet being split apart and them staring at each other it wouldve left the audience wondering who wouldve won i also wish leia had hugged chewie instead of rey it makes way more sense for rey to go with finn rather than chewie although my sister pointed out that maybe chewie went with finn because finn had patched him up which was a cute way to think about overall this is a really fun but familiar entry that ive come to love in the star wars saga

302,the difference between a resistance and a rebellion while not too common i do see posts ripping on the naming of the resistance outside of the common complaint that the resistance is the rebellion 20 there are also criticisms on how the resistance shouldnt be named that because it sounds like theyre opposing the regime in power the new republic i disagree and even though this seems like a dumb semantic issue i would like to address it to highlight the subtle historical differences that inspired the events of the sequel trilogy and how they affect current and future stories  an act of violent or open resistance to an established government or ruler the distinction of an established government or ruler is important because it means it is a matter of legality the empire is the legal successor to the galactic republic and the rebels are fighting solely to restore it to its previous state ergo that is why they are also known as the alliance to restore the republic in accordance with this political tradition the new republic is the legal successor to the empire once the galactic concordance was signed into law   a secret organization opposing authority especially in an occupied country while the empire was a legal entity the first order is a foreign menace from the unknown regions even if the fo shares the empires aesthetic and has former imperial personal the new republic is still the legal successor to the empire the fact that the fo had to seize control by blowing up the nr capital and initiating a blitzkrieg war across the galaxy shows how they are invading upstarts and thugs the formation of the resistance was initially to oppose the potential threat of the fo and convince the nr to take the danger seriously and then they became the main form of opposition once the fo became the de facto governing body unlike the rebellion which wants to oppose the legal ruler the resistance is fighting to throw out an invader and to bring back their legal government  what does this distinction mean for future booksshowscomics when it comes to the stories about the sequel trilogy it looks like the time between tlj and tros is going to mirror occupied europe in ww2 while the rebel alliance was based on vietnamese insurgents waging guerilla warfare the resistance is based on the french marquis of ww2 and other movements opposing the nazis in poland netherlands the soviet union and even in germany itself we’re going to see a lot more kijimi situations and our heroes are going to face potential enemies in the form of fo sympathizers radicals opportunists and collaborators we’ve seen some of this in the poe dameron comics and resistance reborn touches on fo work camps further highlighting the parallels with the nazis,2827,475,-0.8225,0.095,0.812,0.092,0,1
328,"what killed vaderanakin i am posting here to see what others say about it after a comment of mine on the main sub last night got 800 upvotes and i realized not many thought of this  
 in return of the jedi we see vader get weak and die after throwing the emperor down and being electrocuted growing up ive always thought that vader died because the electricity shut his machine down causing him to die however over the last few years i have thought about this in a whole new way  
 the 2017 vader comics we see the emperor use lightning on vader and he seemed to shake it off in a different comic cant remember which one maybe the first vader run we see his suit get deactivated for a period of time and he still managed to survive and then rebels season 2 we is severely injured at the end what if the suit is not the thing keeping him alive but rather the pain from the suit and his injuries  
 if he died because he turned to the light side think about it the dark side uses pain and suffering to get more powerful he lost 4 limbs and was set on fire no normal person could survive that much like maul being cut in half or darth sion for legends fans but they could through the dark side maybe him turning to the light meant that he could no longer use the pain of his suit and his injuries to sustain himself and keep living once he turned he had to let go causing everything to catch up to him and kill him in the process  
to me vaderanakin did not die because of the lightning but rather by turning the light and no longer being fueled by the pain he was constantly in

368,quick rant about the fanbase’s perception of lucas let’s start in 1999 george lucas was loved and respected by the whole fanbase then tpm came out and everyone hated him accusing him of “raping their childhood” comes out he gets more hate less in quantity but hate nonetheless fizzed out some of it but it didn’t compensate for the 6 years of nonstop complaints he received decade later he’s still not in good terms with a lot of the fanbase then disney buys star wars makes the st and now all of the sudden he’s a saint from what i can tell the only reason many fans like him is only so they can use him as leverage to hate the st also use the example that george lucas didn’t like the st to hate on it and that is perfectly valid gl did not like the st the reason for that is because the st was made for fans so people say they dislike the st because it dishonors the fanbase and it does the exact opposite it panders to them i’m not saying if you disliked the st you’re not a true fan i disliked many parts of the st but it’s because of the fans hating the pt that got us the st in the first place i’m not saying that the st is bad either now and this is what is the most bewildering they want george to come back after they bullied him they want george lucas to leave his retirement and his children to satisfy the wants of a fanbase that bullied him  you for listening to my rant mtfbwy thanks for the award,1516,290,-0.9902,0.213,0.67,0.11699999999999999,0,1
389,theory about i am all the sith tldr at bottom tros sidious tells rey that he is all the sith and that he wants her to strike him down so that his essence will pass into her and she will be the new empress further he says that luke skywalkers father was there to save him implying that by blocking lukes attempt to strike down the emperor vader effectively stopped sidious from transferring the essence of all the sith into luke which would have led to his turn to the dark side  theory after being thrown down the shaft by vader the essence of all the sith transferred from sidious to anakin since anakin didnt strike down sidious out of hatred and did it out of love for his son he was not consumed by the dark side spirits and they eventually transferred to palpatines clone on exegol after killing anakin when rey kills palpatine on exegol i think the spirits of the sith transferred from sidious to her but since she killed sidious to save her friends and not out of hatred she was not consumed by the dark side and instead died effectively ending the sith then ben sacrificed himself to revive her theory is compatible with another pet theory of mine that if mace windu had succeeded in killing sidious in rots the sith spirits would have transferred to him and he would fall to the dark side and declare himself emperor under the initial guise of ensuring a peaceful transition to power this makes anakins actions in both the rots and rotj important in fulfilling the prophecy he ensured that neither mace nor luke would fall to the dark side in the attempt to destroy the sith but fell short because he bought sidious enough time to set up a contingency plan on exegol requiring rey and ben to make right the rule of two makes use of essence transfer to compound all of the sith spirits in one vessel that increases in power with each generation anakin broke the cycle and rey ended sidious contingency,1968,354,-0.8573,0.08199999999999999,0.862,0.057,0,1

442,calling what lucasfilm did with the sequels no plan is kinda wrong they had a plan a plan of deliberate ambiguity they werent simply adlibbing the movies and canon with no idea of what they were doing they had a very good logical reason for what they were doing there was only no plan in the sense that nobody sat down before tfa and detailed every single little plot point development and character arc and this is because this couldnt be done at all as i will explain is best reflected in the aftermath trilogy of novels which started coming out just before tfa and concluded months before trevorrow left jj came back and tlj released the conclusion empires end even contains the basic premise of tros spelled out almost verbatim by one of palpatines sith loyalists and advisors this was before trevorrow left at the time when they all were still trying to write a script where palpatine never comes back and kylo is the main monster if that materialized then it would have been trivial to reinterpret canon in such a manner that the loyalist in question is just a lunatic who had no idea what he was talking about as it turns out since even before tfa lucasfilm was developing canon in a direction where palpatine could easily return and it would fit like a glove because the glove was flexible as it turns out palpatine foresaw that the empire could collapse and he spent years secretly exploring the unknown regions with probes and scouts afterwards covertly shipping resources and infrastructure into the shadows in preparation for his ultimate plan  if he is ever killed the empire must be destroyed because it doesnt deserve to exist on the account of failing to protect him and a new empire must rise instead now you could interpret this in three different ways  a palpatine was just petty and the first order is his final fuck you to the galaxy b palpatine planned to resurrect himself along with his empire and c palpatine was actually serving some higher power that c interpretation it would have been used if snoke became the ultimate main bad guy in the sequels the a interpretation would have been used if kylo was the monster in episode ix and they are now using b interpretation because palpatine came back in episode ix that is the product of lucasfilms deliberate ambiguity it works exactly because lucasfilm knew what they were doing also this  the main person tasked with implementing the contingency was a man called gallius rax one of palpatines few true friends and allies he was an orphan from guess what planet jakku and the pinnacle of the contingency involved gathering the combined strength of the empire and the new republic above jakku and destroying them all allowing palpatines loyalists to retreat into the unknown regions and resurrect the empire afterwards however rax died before the plan could be fulfilled the new republic won at jakku but the loyalists were still able to retreat in the unknown regions the republic celebrated the seeming victory and the end of the war while jakku became a graveyard of the empire and a few decades later the lost princess of the empire would be rummaging through the ruins of her grandfathers empire and living in one of his destroyed war machines ungodly convenient wouldnt you say it isnt its a consequence of deliberate ambiguity in tfa and background canon why did lucasfilm chose to make it like this well the reason is obvious  the three director approach demanded it because if you already have three directors you want them to have as much freedom as possible while also making sure canon doesnt become too much contradictory as a result of what happens in the movies hence you get lucasfilms guidance of canon development towards deliberate ambiguity or the flexible glove to use the analogy again the conclusion in episode ix whatever it was would signal the end of ambiguity and subsequent canon material would retcon away and smooth over any small inconsistencies good plan to be frank and it would have worked flawlessly if carrie didnt die and if later lucasfilm and trevorrow didnt fail to reach a compromise and produce a decent script,4274,724,0.9314,0.077,0.826,0.09699999999999999,0,1
