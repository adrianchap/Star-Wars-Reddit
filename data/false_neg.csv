238,han and leia were split up so the takodana subplot with maz could happen think about it why doesn’t han take the droid with the location of luke fucking skywalker straight to leia because he “used to be” han solo that’s why the writers needed to kill some screentime and were on such a rushed deadline that they didn’t actually critically think through their ideas takodana was needed to kill some screen time and introduce a wise new force mentor for our characters but the writers couldn’t figure out a logical way to do it so they wrote down the easiest idea that came to their head so han can’t see leia because they’re separated why couldn’t han have been evading spies while on this secret mission for the resistance oh yeah that’s right this production was so rushed that nobody thought things through until it was over,838,148,0.5858,0.037000000000000005,0.8959999999999999,0.068,1,0

295,speculation mando s2 ill tie in to anakins saber and maz so this is just random speculation but someone on another sub put forward the theory that ahsoka will be the one to give the blue saber to maz and it will happen in the mandalorian only evidence for this mind you is that in tfa a razorcrest class ship can be seen in the woods of mazs castle and supposedly someone says that they saw something about ahsoka having a blue saber dont want to panic over so little but the idea of linking the mandalorian into the plotline of the reboots pisses me off soooooooo much of all i just want to forget the reboots and i cant do that with mando bringing it up its not going to fix maz absentbecauseofatradedispute kanata as a character or the absurdity of that saber being just dropped into tfa most importantly it will make mandalorian feel like a glorified connectthedots scavenger hunt which is what ruined solo for me mando is its own thing and succeeded so well last season because it took a parallel path to the main story showing us the declining empire and the bounty hunter culture and expanding on it without tying it into what we already know making it a mere adjunct to the reboot will dilute its identity and encumber the plot arc,1300,234,0.8954,0.057,0.855,0.08800000000000001,1,0

 a shame as before 2017  i’d spent a fortune as i do supporting the thing i love like i do my favourite bands etc now as tempted as i am i just look at them even if i see otpt stuff on sale or cheap i look at it and shrug it’s funny how they say “oh star wars fans will say they hate the thing and still buy into it” but not me i wonder if anyone else is the same i mean the fact that sales of merch dropped rapidly means there’s got to be a lot somewhere",1534,302,0.9745,0.098,0.74,0.162,1,0
